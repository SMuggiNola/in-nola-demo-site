      <h1>Profiles in Progress: Paddy &amp; JJ Muggivan</h1>
      <p>
        Working portraits of two generations of the Muggivan family whose lives stretch
        from Derrycon above Mountshannon to seminaries in Ireland and priesthood in the
        United States: <strong>Patrick “Paddy” Muggivan</strong> and his son,
        <strong>John “JJ” Muggivan</strong>.

            <h2>I. Background &amp; Locale</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Lived in <strong>Derrycon</strong>, above Mountshannon, with views over Lough Derg and the River Shannon.</li>
              <li>Came from a <strong>rural farming family</strong> with limited formal schooling.</li>
              <li>Was likely <strong>semi-literate or illiterate</strong>, which deeply shaped:
                <ul>
                  <li>His reluctance to speak in public.</li>
                  <li>His avoidance of paperwork and official processes.</li>
                  <li>His silence with his children and limited narrative explanations.</li>
                  <li>Why so much of his story survived only as fragments.</li>

            <h2>II. IRA Activity (c. 1918–1921)</h2>
            <p>
              Based on inherited stories and known patterns of the East Clare struggle,
              Paddy was likely a member of the <strong>East Clare IRA, Mountshannon Company</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Probable activities included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acting as a <strong>lookout</strong> for riverboats carrying British soldiers along the Shannon.</li>
              <li>Participating in <strong>raids</strong> on local estates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In one raid, he was friendly with the woman of the targeted estate and tried to
              warn her. The warning failed and <strong>one IRA man was killed</strong>. This
              incident carries guilt, ambiguity, and danger all at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              His role appears to have been that of a <strong>rank-and-file Volunteer</strong>,
              oriented toward physical action rather than administration or paperwork.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>III. Betrayal, Arrest &amp; Killaloe Jail</h2>
            <p>
              While cutting turf with a local man with intellectual disabilities
              (referred to as “the simpleton”), Paddy was betrayed and arrested by the RIC.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both he and the disabled man were taken to <strong>Killaloe jail</strong>.</li>
              <li>They were kept in a yard locked at night.</li>
              <li>Guards threw <strong>chickens into a communal stew pot</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In a moment of dark humor, Paddy told his companion:
              <em>“If they run out of chickens, they might throw you in next.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The setting, timing, and style of arrest match known patterns from East Clare
              at the time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>IV. Treaty Week Release (December 1921)</h2>
            <p>
              Shortly after the <strong>Anglo-Irish Treaty</strong> was signed on
              6 December 1921, prisoners were abruptly released.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paddy and the disabled man were <strong>ordered out at night</strong>.</li>
              <li>They had to walk away in the dark, fearing they might be shot.</li>
              <li>They likely crossed the <strong>Portumna bridge</strong>, near where the
                <strong>Scariff Martyrs</strong> had been shot weeks earlier in a staged “escape”.</li>
              <li>They walked back toward Mountshannon, learning along the way that the Treaty had been signed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The timing, geography, and emotional atmosphere match historical reality
              across East Clare at the end of the War of Independence.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>V. Anti-Treaty Position &amp; Retaliatory Shot</h2>
            <p>
              After the Treaty, Paddy aligned with the <strong>Anti-Treaty side</strong>,
              following de Valera and other opponents of the settlement.
            </p>
            <p>
              IRA leadership discouraged <strong>independent retaliation</strong> during this
              volatile transition. But once Paddy identified the local man who had betrayed him
              (likely an RIC figure), he took action:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Walked to the family farm in Derrycon and retrieved his <strong>shotgun</strong>.</li>
              <li>Returned to Mountshannon village.</li>
              <li><strong>Fired at the betrayer’s door</strong> from across the street — a symbolic, non-lethal act.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Realizing he had acted outside IRA orders and risked further violence or arrest,
              he <strong>buried the shotgun in a field</strong>. Decades later, your uncle found
              the rusted barrel, giving the story physical confirmation.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VI. Exile to New York</h2>
            <p>
              To prevent further conflict, retaliation, or civil war entanglement, IRA leadership
              arranged for Paddy to go to <strong>New York</strong> in the early 1920s (c. 1922–1924/5).
            </p>
            <p>This kind of “cooling-off exile” was common and served to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Protect Volunteers at risk.</li>
              <li>Defuse local feuds and potential revenge cycles.</li>
              <li>Avoid internecine violence as the Civil War loomed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While in New York, he bought a <strong>white second-hand suit</strong>. On his return
              to Mountshannon, when he walked into the pub, locals joked:
              <em>“Jesus, look at the baker!”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The image fits: a quiet man, uncomfortable with attention, drawn into a
              transatlantic arc he never fully narrated.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VII. Land Redistribution at Keenes Pub</h2>
            <p>
              During the 1930s–40s, land reclaimed from estates was redistributed by the
              <strong>Land Commission</strong>. In Mountshannon, the process took place at
              <strong>Keenes Pub</strong>, a long-standing family pub.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paddy attended the meeting but stayed <strong>silent</strong>.</li>
              <li>He did not nominate himself for land.</li>
              <li>Someone finally called him out publicly:
                <em>“Jesus Paddy! You fought the bleeding Brits, will you take some land for yourself?”</em>
              </li>
              <li>He eventually accepted land, helping shape the farm that remained part of the family landscape.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The scene captures a man who had fought, suffered, and yet still hesitated
              to claim what he had earned.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VIII. Illiteracy as a Central Thread</h2>
            <p>
              Paddy’s probable semi-literacy or illiteracy is not a side detail — it is a
              central structuring force in his life story.
            </p>
            <p>It helps explain:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>His discomfort with <strong>public speaking</strong>.</li>
              <li>Why he never applied for an <strong>IRA pension</strong>.</li>
              <li>Why he left no <strong>written record</strong> of his experiences.</li>
              <li>The heavy <strong>silence</strong> around his life and emotions.</li>
              <li>The fragmentary way stories survived into the next generation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is entirely consistent with the lives of many rural men of his generation
              in East Clare and across Ireland.

            <h2>I. Birth &amp; Early Context</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Born <strong>31 May 1942</strong>, with the birth officially registered (incorrectly) as <strong>30 May</strong>.</li>
              <li>Born in <strong>Galway</strong>, moved into County Clare due to a later <strong>boundary shift</strong>.</li>
              <li>Registered <strong>six months late</strong>, which complicates the record trail.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>II. Siblings &amp; Infant Loss</h2>
            <p>
              The siblings are split across Galway and Clare registrations, with at least
              two infant deaths. The most probable reconstruction is:
            </p>

            <h3>Galway-era Children</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Delia</strong> (possibly the eldest).</li>
              <li><strong>Jerry</strong> (older brother; frequent fights with JJ).</li>
              <li><strong>Infant #1</strong> — likely died at or shortly after birth, possibly JJ’s twin.</li>
              <li><strong>JJ</strong> (your father).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Clare-era Children</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tony</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Tom</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Marie</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Francis</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Unknown Clare sibling</strong> — appears in civil records but is not remembered in family oral history.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Total: <strong>9 births</strong>, with <strong>7 surviving children</strong> and
              <strong>2 infant deaths</strong> (one almost certainly at or around JJ’s birth).
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>III. Tuberculosis &amp; Childhood Disruption</h2>
            <p>
              JJ’s mother was hospitalized with <strong>tuberculosis</strong> (TB). The children
              were distributed among neighbors and extended family — a documented public health
              practice at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For JJ, this meant early experiences of <strong>separation, instability, and fear</strong>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>IV. Trauma &amp; Early Hardship</h2>
            <p>Key traumatic experiences in JJ’s early life included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Harsh physical punishment by a local teacher — hiding under a table while
                the cane struck the furniture above.</li>
              <li>Frequent <strong>violent fights</strong> with his brother Jerry.</li>
              <li>Serious leg problems requiring <strong>drainage</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> and major health issues.</li>
              <li>Deep feelings of <strong>abandonment and fear</strong> as a small child.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These experiences set a psychological backdrop of instability, anger, and
              mistrust of authority.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>V. Minor Seminary at Mungret (Limerick)</h2>
            <p>
              JJ was sent to the <strong>minor seminary at Mungret</strong>, near Limerick.
              This move was arranged by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>His mother (“Mammy”).</li>
              <li>The wife of a doctor she met in the TB hospital.</li>
              <li>The doctor himself, who had connections to Scariff and paid the fees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There may have been an unspoken link between this support and a
              <strong>card-game death</strong> that weighed on the doctor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mungret was known for being <strong>brutal, punitive, and academically demanding</strong>,
              especially for rural boys like JJ.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>He arrived <strong>academically behind</strong> and had to be “caught up”.</li>
              <li>He was <strong>mocked for his accent</strong>.</li>
              <li>He experienced physical punishment with <strong>leather straps</strong> on the palms.</li>
              <li>He <strong>cycled to see his mother</strong> in hospital.</li>
              <li>He endured a religious ritual lying on the floor with arms outstretched.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VI. The Rejection of Hell</h2>
            <p>
              At some point in seminary formation, JJ rejected the Catholic concept of
              <strong>Hell</strong> as a place of eternal punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a major psychological break: it stripped away a central tool
              of fear-based control and opened the possibility of a faith grounded
              in justice and conscience rather than terror.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VII. “Because Your Mammy Wants It”</h2>
            <p>
              JJ once asked <strong>Bill Tierney</strong> why he was becoming a priest.
              Bill’s answer was blunt:
            </p>
            <p><em>“Because your Mammy wants it.”</em></p>
            <p>
              That sentence shattered the illusion that priesthood was purely a divine
              calling. It exposed the mix of family expectation, guilt, and social
              pressure behind his vocation.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <h2>VIII. Carlow, America &amp; Leaving the Priesthood</h2>
            <p>
              JJ continued on to <strong>Carlow seminary</strong> and eventually emigrated
              to the United States as a priest, landing in <strong>San Antonio</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>In America he:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clashed with church leadership.</li>
              <li>Took <strong>radical positions on civil rights</strong>.</li>
              <li>Challenged authority structures inside and outside the Church.</li>
              <li>Eventually <strong>left the priesthood</strong>.</li>
              <li>Met your mother.</li>
              <li>Became a <strong>social worker</strong>, rebuilding his identity around
                justice, care, and advocacy for the vulnerable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This arc — from traumatized rural boy, to reluctant seminarian, to radical
              priest, to social worker — fits the psychological profile shaped by his
              childhood and his father’s silence.

            <p>
              Your uncle once showed you a piece of forest outside Mountshannon that served
              as a <strong>cillín</strong> — an unofficial burial ground for unbaptized infants.
            </p>
            <p>A cillín typically:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Was used when infants died before baptism.</li>
              <li>Had <strong>makeshift grave markers</strong> rather than formal headstones.</li>
              <li>Rarely appeared in official records.</li>
              <li>Survived mainly in <strong>oral memory</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is highly plausible that the <strong>missing infant</strong>, possibly JJ’s twin,
              is buried there. This would explain:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The absence of formal records.</li>
              <li>The family’s silence on the subject.</li>
              <li>JJ’s felt sense of a missing twin.</li>
              <li>The “gap” in the birth order.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>II. Where the Records Are (and Aren’t)</h2>
            <p><strong>Online (IrishGenealogy.ie):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Birth images up to <strong>1924</strong>.</li>
              <li>Death indexes up to <strong>1973</strong>.</li>
              <li>Marriage images up to <strong>1948</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Not available online:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>JJ’s 1942 birth record.</li>
              <li>The missing twin’s record.</li>
              <li>The “unknown Clare sibling” post-1924.</li>
              <li>Most parish registers from the 1920s–40s.</li>
              <li>Cillín burials (almost never formally recorded).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Places you must visit or write to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Roscommon</strong> — for Galway civil registers.</li>
              <li><strong>Ennis</strong> — for Clare civil registers.</li>
              <li><strong>Mountshannon / Scariff parish offices</strong> — for any informal notes or local registers.</li>

            <h2>III. Most Probable Sibling Reconstruction</h2>
            <p>
              Putting all of this together, the most probable sibling set looks like this:
            </p>

            <h3>Galway Births</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Delia</li>
              <li>Jerry</li>
              <li>Infant who died at or shortly after birth (likely JJ’s twin)</li>
              <li>JJ (your father)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Clare Births</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Tony</li>
              <li>Tom</li>
              <li>Marie</li>
              <li>Francis</li>
              <li>Unknown Clare sibling (present in civil records only)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This yields <strong>9 children</strong> total, with <strong>7 surviving</strong>
              and <strong>2 dying in infancy</strong>.
