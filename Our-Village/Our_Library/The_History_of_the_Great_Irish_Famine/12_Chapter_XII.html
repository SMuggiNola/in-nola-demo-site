<p>The year 1846 closed in gloom. It left the Irish people sinking in
thousands into their graves, under the influence of a famine as general
as it was intense, and which trampled down every barrier set up to stay
its desolating progress. But the worst had not yet come. It was in 1847
that the highest point of misery and death had been reached. Skibbereen,
to be sure, ceased to attract so much attention as it had been
previously doing, but the people of that devoted town had received much
relief; besides, there were now fewer mouths to fill there, so many were
closed in death, at the Windmill-hill, in the Workhouse grounds, and in
the churchyard of Abbeystrowry. Instead of one, Ireland had now many
Skibbereens. In short, the greater part of it might be regarded as one
vast Skibbereen. In the Autumn of 1846, the famine, which all saw
advancing, seized upon certain districts of the South and West; but as
ulcers, which first appear in isolated spots upon the body, enlarge
until, touching each other, they become confluent, so had the famine,
limited in its earlier stages to certain localities, now spread itself
over the entire country. Hence, it is not in any new forms of suffering
amongst the famine-stricken people that its increasing horrors are to be
looked for: it is in its universality, and in the deadly effects of a
new scourge—fever—which was not only manifesting itself throughout the
land at this time, but had already risen to an alarming height—a thing
not to be wondered at, because it is the certain offspring, as well as
the powerful auxiliary, of famine.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1846, several parts of Clare were in a very wretched
condition; but, at the opening of the new year, the most prosperous
localities in that county had been sucked into the great famine vortex.
Writing at this period from Ennis, the chief town, Captain Wynne says:
"The <a id="Page_366"></a>number of those who, from age or exhaustion and infirmity, are
unable to labour, is becoming most alarming; to those the public works
are of no use; they are, no doubt, fit subjects for private charity and
the exertions of relief committees, but it is vain to look to these
sources for relief at all commensurate with the magnitude of the demand.
Deaths are occurring from Famine, and there can be no doubt that the
Famine advances upon us with giant strides." Several of the officials
who had written to Sir Randolph Routh and others, from different parts
of the country, blamed the people for their listlessness, their
idleness, and the little interest they seemed to take in cropping their
land, in order to secure a future supply of food. Addressing himself to
this point, Captain Wynne says: "It is in vain to direct their [the
people's] attention to the prosecution of those agricultural operations
which can alone place any limit to their present deplorable condition.
Agricultural labour holds out a distant prospect of reward—their
present necessities require immediate relief. Such is their state of
alarm and despair at the prospect before them, that they cannot be
induced to look beyond to-morrow; <i>thousands never expect to see the
harvest</i>. I must say the majority exhibit a great deal of patience,
meekness, and submission." Again, in the same letter: "The effects of
the Famine are discernible everywhere: not a domestic animal to be
seen—pigs and poultry have quite disappeared. The dogs have also
vanished, except here and there the ghost of one, buried in the skeleton
of one of those victims of cruelty and barbarity, which have been so
numerous here within the last two months—I allude to the horses and
donkeys that were shot. It is an alarming fact that, this day, in the
town of Ennis, there was not a stone of breadstuff of any description to
be had on any terms, nor a loaf of bread."<a href="#Footnote_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213" class="pginternal">[213]</a></p>
<p><a id="Page_367"></a>In the chief cities, the pressure of the Famine, day by day, became
greater. In Belfast, the flourishing seat of the linen trade, one of the
gentlemen appointed to visit the different districts, with the view of
ascertaining the real amount of distress amongst the poor, writes in the
following terms to the <i>Northern Whig</i>: "There is not any necessity that
I should point out individual cases of abject want, though in my
visitations I have seen many of whose extreme destitution I could not
possibly have formed a true estimate had I not seen them. Let it
suffice, however, to state, that in many of our back lanes and courts
there are families in the veriest wretchedness, with scarcely enough of
rags to cover their shivering emaciated bodies; they may be found
huddled together around a handful of dying cinders, or endeavouring to
fan into flame a small heap of damp smoking sawdust Perhaps when they
have not been happy enough to procure even that scanty fuel, they will
be found, to the number of five or six—some well, some ill, and all
bearing the aspect of pinching hunger—endeavouring to procure warmth by
crouching together upon a scanty heap of filthy straw, or mouldering
wood shavings, their only covering an old worn-out rag of a blanket or a
coverlet, that has been so patched and re-patched that its original
texture or colour it would be impossible to discern. On looking around
this miserable dwelling, nothing meets the eye save the damp floor and
the bare walls, down which the rain, or condensed vapour, is plentifully
streaming. Not a stool, chair, or seat of any description, in many
instances, is to be seen, nor commonest utensil; and as for food, not so
much as would satisfy the cravings of even a hungry infant. Let not this
picture be deemed overdrawn. If any one suppose it exaggerated, had that
individual been with me, on Sunday last, I could have shown him some
instances of suffering, that would have removed all doubt regarding the
reality of distress in Belfast. I will merely mention one of them:—"I
entered a house to which my <a id="Page_368"></a>attention had been directed; in the kitchen
there was not a single article of furniture—not even a live cinder on
the cold deserted-looking hearth. In the inner room I found a woman,
lately confined, lying upon a heap of chopped-up rotten straw, with
scarcely a rag to cover her; beside her nestled two children, pictures
of want, and in her bosom lay her undressed babe, that, four days
before, had first seen the light. She had no food in the house, nor had
she, nor her children, had anything since her confinement, save a little
soup procured from the public kitchen. Such was her statement; and the
evidence of her wretched dwelling bore but too ample testimony to her
melancholy tale."</p>
<p>Large numbers were in a state of utter destitution in the city of Cork.
As happened in other cities and important towns, the country people
flocked in to swell the misery; and roaming in groups through the
streets, exhibiting their wretchedness, and imploring relief, they gave
them a most sad and deplorable appearance. Even the houses of once
respectable tradesmen, denuded of every article of furniture, and
without fuel or bedding, presented a most affecting spectacle of want
and misery. And so impressed were the committee of the Society of
Friends in Cork with the sufferings of this class, that a separate
subscription was raised for supplying them with straw beds and some
fuel. The apparatus which this committee had erected for the making of
soup was, they thought at first, on too extensive a scale, but it was
soon found to be insufficient to meet the calls which were daily made
upon it. Their Report of the 1st of February says: "Our distribution of
soup is rapidly increasing; during the past week it averaged one
thousand and sixteen quarts a-day, and on seventh day it reached the
extent of twelve hundred and sixty-eight quarts." It went on increasing
until it had, a fortnight later, reached fourteen hundred quarts a-day.
Besides the distribution of soup by the Society of Friends, there were
four district soup houses, supplying over six-thousand quarts of soup
<a id="Page_369"></a>daily; so that, at this time, forty-eight thousand quarts of soup were
made and distributed weekly in the city of Cork. There was a nominal
charge of a penny or so a quart for some of this soup, but much of it
was given away gratuitously. Speaking of the accounts from different
parts of the county Cork, the Report says:—"Where the potato crop was
most completely annihilated—in the far west—the Famine first appeared,
but other quarters were also invaded, as the remnant of the crop became
blighted or consumed. Hence, in localities, which until recently but
slightly participated in this afflictive visitation, distress and
destitution are now spreading, and the accounts from some of these are
presenting the same features of appalling misery as those which
originally burst upon an affrighted nation from the neighbourhood of
Skibbereen." In the postscript of a letter to the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, Rev.
James O'Driscoll, P.P., writing from Kilmichael, says: "Since writing
the above a young man named Manley, in fever at Cooldorahey, had to be
visited. He was found in a dying state, without one to tend him. <i>His
sister and brother lay dead quite close to him in the same room. The
sister was dead for five days, and the brother for three days</i>. He also
died, being the last of a large family. The three were interred by means
of a sliding coffin."</p>
<p>The Cork Workhouse was crowded to excess, and the number of deaths in
it, at this time, was simply frightful: they were one hundred and
seventy-four in a single week—more than one death in every hour.<a href="#Footnote_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214" class="pginternal">[214]</a>
In one day, in the beginning of February, there were forty-four corpses
in the house; and on the 10th of that month one hundred bodies were
conveyed for interment to a small suburban burial place near Cork.
Several persons were found dead in the streets; numbers of bodies were
left unburied for want of coffins. Under a shed at the Shandon
guard-house lay some thirty-eight human beings; old and young, men,
women, and <a id="Page_370"></a>infants of tenderest age, huddled together like so many pigs
or dogs, on the ground, without any covering but the rags on their
persons.<a href="#Footnote_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215" class="pginternal">[215]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Limerick Examiner</i>, in giving an account of the state of the poor
in that city, publishes a day's experience of one of the Catholic
priests in the Parish of St. John. In one day he was called to officiate
at the death-beds of seven persons who were dying of starvation, the
families of which they were members comprising, in all, twenty-three
souls. The wretched abodes in which he found them were much of the same
character—no beds, scarcely any clothing, no food, the children quite
naked. In one of those miserable dwellings he could not procure a light,
to be used whilst administering the Sacraments to a dying woman; and
such was the general poverty around, that <i>the loan of a candle could
not be obtained in the neighbourhood</i>. His last visit was to a girl in
fever, who had had three relapses. He found her father and mother
tottering on their limbs from want. The father said he had a dimness in
his eyes, and he thought he would become mad from hunger before night.</p>
<p>Dublin, notwithstanding its many advantages, did not escape the
all-pervading scourge. In the month of December, 1846, there were seven
hundred persons under treatment for dysentery in the South Union
Workhouse, besides convalescents. The disease proved more fatal than
cholera. Parochial meetings were held, and committees appointed to
collect funds for the relief of the starving people; besides which a
meeting of the citizens was convened at the Music Hall, on the 23rd of
December, to form a general committee for the whole city. In the
unavoidable absence of the Lord Mayor, it was presided over by Alderman
Staunton, Lord Mayor elect. The meeting was very numerously attended by
leading citizens and clergymen of <a id="Page_371"></a>various denominations. Amongst the
latter were the Most Rev. Dr. Murray, Archbishop of Dublin, and the
Provost of Trinity College. A committee was formed, whose duties were to
raise funds, and, "by a due disbursement thereof," for the relief of the
necessitous, to endeavour to mitigate "the alarming and unparalleled
distress of the poor of the city," and so arrest the progress of "a
train of evils that must otherwise follow in the track of famine."</p>
<p>Four days later "The General Central Relief Committee for all Ireland"
sprang into existence, under the chairmanship of the Marquis of Kildare,
the present Duke of Leinster. This became a very important and useful
body, having disbursed, during the year of its existence, over seventy
thousand pounds. Greater still were the results achieved by a committee
formed on the 13th of November, 1846, by the Society of Friends. That
admirably managed body sent members of the Society to the most
distressed parts of the country, in order to investigate on the spot the
real state of things, and report upon them. This committee received from
various parts of the world, the very large sum of £198,326 15s. 5d., two
thousand seven hundred of which remained unappropriated when they closed
their glorious labours in the cause of benevolence. But of all the
charitable organizations produced by the Famine, the most remarkable was
"The British Association for the Relief of <i>Extreme Distress</i> in Ireland
and Scotland."<a href="#Footnote_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216" class="pginternal">[216]</a> This association received in subscriptions, at home
and abroad, over £600,000. The <a id="Page_372"></a>balance in hands, when they drew up
their report, was the very trifling one of fourteen hundred pounds;
whilst so many of those more immediately connected with this gigantic
work laboured gratuitously, that the whole expense of management was
only £12,000, barely two per cent. Further on, I shall have an
opportunity of speaking more in detail of charitable committees.</p>
<p>There is one curious fact regarding the Government in connection with
those committees. It is this: The Government seemed anxious to have it
understood, that it was not the money outlay which concerned or alarmed
them, but the difficulty of procuring food, and the probability of not
being able to procure it in sufficient quantity, by any amount of
exertion within their power. "Last year," writes Mr. Trevelyan, "it was
a money question, and we were able to buy food enough to supply the
local deficiency; but this year it is a food question. The stock of food
for the whole United Kingdom is much less than is required; and if we
were to purchase for Irish use faster than we are now doing, we should
commit a crying injustice to the rest of the country." And again, in the
same letter: "I repeat that it is not a money question. If twice the
value of all the meal which has been, or will be, bought, would save the
people, it would be paid for at once."<a href="#Footnote_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217" class="pginternal">[217]</a> In face of this assertion,
our Government, as we have already seen, allowed the French, Belgians,
and Dutch, who were in far less need than we, to be in the food markets
before them, and to buy as much as they required—even in Liverpool,
which they cleared of Indian corn in a single day. If food were the
difficulty, and not money, it is not easy to see what great advantage
there was in those charitable associations, formed to receive <i>money</i>
subscriptions for the purchase of food. Of what use was money, if food
were not procurable with it? The aid of such bodies, in <a id="Page_373"></a>investigating
cases of destitution and distributing food, would, no doubt, be very
valuable; but this service they could render the Government as well
without subscriptions as with them. Writing to Sir R. Routh, in
December, 1846, Mr. Trevelyan says: "I have continued to forward the
plan of a private subscription, as far as it lay in my power, both in
Ireland and in England; and Sir George Grey (Home Secretary) has
rendered his more powerful assistance. I think it will be brought to
bear."<a href="#Footnote_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218" class="pginternal">[218]</a> It was brought to bear; and in a later communication, he
speaks of the British Association with evident satisfaction. "The
subscription is going on very well," he says; "six names down for a
thousand pounds each, and a good working committee organized."<a href="#Footnote_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219" class="pginternal">[219]</a></p>
<p>The Government, it may be fairly said, should not refuse any aid
proffered to them. Certainly not; but they did more. They showed a
decided anxiety to receive aid in money, not only from landlords, who
were bound to give it, but from any and every quarter—even from the
Great Turk himself, who subscribed a thousand pounds out of his bankrupt
treasury, to feed the starving subjects of the richest nation in the
world. And the noblemen and gentlemen who signed the Address of Thanks
to the Sultan Abdul Medjid Khan, for his subscription, amongst other
things, say to his majesty, that "It had pleased Providence, in its
wisdom, to deprive this country suddenly of its staple article of food,
and to visit the poor inhabitants with privations, such as have seldom
fallen to the lot of any civilized nation to endure. In this emergency,
the people of Ireland <i>had no other alternative but to appeal to the
kindness and munificence of other countries</i> less afflicted than
themselves, to save them and their families from famine and death."<a href="#Footnote_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220" class="pginternal">[220]</a>
Besides making the Famine a <a id="Page_374"></a>money question, this address contains the
blasphemous attack upon Divine Providence, so current at the time among
politicians. William Bennett, one of those praiseworthy gentlemen whom
the Society of Friends sent to distribute relief in the Far West, was,
however, of opinion that the responsibility of the Irish Famine should
not be laid at the door of Divine Providence, at least without some
little investigation. In his letters to his committee, he endeavoured,
he says, to give a bird's-eye view, as it were, of the distressed
portions of Ireland, drawn upon the spot, with the vivid delineation of
truth, but without exaggeration or colouring. And what is the picture,
he asks? "Take the line of the main course of the Shannon continued
north to Lough Swilly, and south to Cork. It divides the island into two
great portions, east and west. In the eastern there are distress and
poverty enough, as part of the same body suffering from the same cause;
but there is much to redeem. In the west it exhibits a people, not in
the centre of Africa, the steppes of Asia, the backwoods of America—not
some newly-discovered tribes of South Australia, or among the Polynesian
Islands—not Hottentots, Bushmen, or Esquimaux—neither Mahommedans nor
Pagans—but some millions of our own Christian nation at home, living in
a state and condition low and degraded to a degree unheard of before in
any civilized community; driven periodically to the borders of
starvation; and now reduced by a national calamity to an exigency which
all the efforts of benevolence can only mitigate, not control; and under
which thousands are not merely pining away in misery and wretchedness,
but are dying like cattle off the face of the earth, from want and its
kindred horrors! <i>Is this to be regarded in the light of a Divine
dispensation and punishment? Before we can safely arrive at such a
conclusion, we must be satisfied that human agency and legislation,
individual oppressions, and social relationships have had no <a id="Page_375"></a>hand in
it</i>."<a href="#Footnote_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221" class="pginternal">[221]</a> Was it not a money question, when a labourer at task work
could only earn 8d. or 8-1/4d. a-day?—not enough to buy one meal of
food for a moderate sized family. No, no, answered the Government
people; this low rate of wages is fixed, in order not to attract labour
from the cultivation of the soil. Now, in the famine time, the labourer,
as a rule, could not obtain money wages for the cultivation of the
soil—a fact well known to the Government; so that <i>money wages</i> of
almost any amount must withdraw him from agriculture, from the absolute
necessity he was under of warding off immediate starvation. If,
therefore, Government wished the labour of the country to be employed in
cultivating and improving the soil, why did they not, instead of
spoiling the roads, so employ that labour at fair money wages, and
subject to just and proper conditions? They were often urged to do it,
but in vain. They yielded at last, but at an absurdly late period for
such a concession.</p>
<p>Further: if it were solely a food question, the Government should have
used all the means in their power to bring food into the country, which
they did not do; because they refused to suspend the navigation
laws—this free-trade government did, and thus deliberately excluded
supplies from our ports. By the navigation laws, merchandize could be
brought to these countries only in British ships, or in ships belonging
to the nation which produced the merchandize. The importation of corn
fell under this <i>protective</i> regulation. If those laws were suspended in
time, food could be carried to British ports in the ships of <i>any</i>
nation; and in fact, whilst a great outcry was raised by our Government
about the scarcity of food, and the want of ships to carry it, Odessa
and other food centres were crowded with vessels, <i>looking for freights
to England, but could not obtain them</i>, in consequence of the operation
of <a id="Page_376"></a>the navigation laws. The immediate effect was, a great difficulty in
sending food to those parts of Ireland where the people were dying of
sheer starvation. But a second effect was, the enrichment, to an
enormous extent, of the owners of the mercantile marine of England;
freights having nearly doubled in almost every instance, and in a most
important one, that of America, nearly trebled. The freights from London
to Irish ports had fully trebled.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister came down to Parliament at the end of January, 1847,
and proposed the suspension of the Navigation Laws until the first of
September following; in order, he said, that freights might be lowered
and food come in more abundantly; but, as one of the members said in the
debate that followed, the proposal, good in itself, came too late, being
made at a time when the surplus of the harvest of 1846 was to a great
extent, disposed of. In his speech proposing the suspension of the
Navigation Laws, Lord John Russell used, of course, in its favour the
arguments which everybody was tired pressing upon himself for months
before; but he especially dwelt upon the great increase of freights. The
ordinary freight from the Danube, said his lordship, used to be 10s. the
quarter; it is now 16s. 6d. to 17s.; from Odessa, 8s.; it is 13s. to
13s. 6d. at present: from the United States, 5s.; it is now 12s. 6d. to
13s.; and what concerns Ireland still more, he said, the usual freight
from London to Cork was 1s. to 1s. 3d. the quarter, and often
considerably less; it is now 3s. to 3s. 6d. the quarter, with much
difficulty in finding vessels even at those freights.</p>
<p>Lord John and his representatives in Ireland were exceedingly fond of
propounding free trade principles to those who complained that the Irish
harvest—the natural food of the Irish people—was being taken out of
the country. O'Connell, early in the Famine, said: close your ports
against the exportation of your corn—open them to the corn markets of
the world. This and the like advice was <a id="Page_377"></a>ridiculed as "Protection," and
"Ignorance," by those ostentatious apostles of free trade, who kept the
Navigation Laws in full force, in order to protect the monopoly of
English shipowners; and who, rather than share with other nations the
profits arising from carrying the food which would have saved the Irish
people, <i>protected that monopoly</i>, and left their fellow subjects to die
of famine, rather than withdraw the protection. Talk of Lord John and
his free trade government after that.</p>
<p>In the letter already quoted from the <i>Commissariat Series</i> (p. 409),
and bearing date the 24th of December, Mr. Trevelyan, on the part of the
Government, says to Sir R. Routh: "You write as if it were in our power
to purchase grain and meal at our discretion, but I can assure you that
this is far from being the case. The London and Liverpool markets are in
a more exhausted state than you appear to be aware of, and the supplies
which are to be expected till April, are so totally inadequate to
filling the immense void which has been created by the failure of the
potato crop, the deficiency of the Spring crops, and the foreign demand,
that they give us no confidence.... You must therefore bear in mind, and
impress upon all those with whom you are acting, that even the stock of
food at your disposal has a certain fixed limit, and that it must be
economized, and made to last the requisite time, like any private stock.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer will, on no account, permit you to
undertake to provide food for any portion of the Eastern district of
Ireland. What we have is insufficient even for the Western district, for
which we have undertaken.... No exigency, however pressing, is to induce
you to undertake to furnish supplies of food for any districts, except
those for which we have already undertaken."</p>
<p>This letter, written, as all Mr. Trevelyan's were, by the authority of
the Treasury, assumes that the Government had a full knowledge of the
state of the food markets. <a id="Page_378"></a>And, no doubt, it was their bounden duty to
collect such knowledge, by trusty agents, despatched at the earliest
moment, to investigate and report upon the harvest-yield in Europe and
America. Yet, at the very time it was written, President Polk's message
to Congress, delivered in Washington on the 8th of December, arrived in
England, containing the following passage: "The home market alone is
inadequate to enable them [the farmers] to dispose of the immense
supplies of food which they are capable of producing, even at the most
reduced prices, for the manifest reason that they cannot be consumed in
the country. The United States can, from their immense surplus, supply
not only the home demand, but the deficiency of food required by the
whole world."</p>
<p>Was it a money question or a food question?</p>
<p>There was, naturally enough, a mournful sameness in the news from every
part of the country: starvation, famine, fever, death; such are the
commonest headings in the newspapers of the time. Seven deaths from
starvation near Cootehill was the announcement from a locality supposed
not to be at all severely visited. In Clifden, County Galway, the
distress was fearful; 5000 persons there were said to be trying to live
on field roots and seaweed. A Catholic priest who was a curate in the
County Galway during the Famine, but who now occupies, as he well
deserves to do, a high position in the Irish Church, has kindly supplied
the author with some of his famine experiences. There are five
churchyards in the parish where he then ministered. Four of these had to
be enlarged by one half during the famine, and the fifth, an entirely
new one, became also necessary, that there might be ground enough
wherein to inter the famine-slain people. This enlargement of burial
accommodation took place, as a rule throughout the South, West, and
North-west. One day as this priest was going to attend his sick
calls—and there was no end of sick calls in those times—he met a man
with <a id="Page_379"></a>a donkey and cart. On the cart there were three coffins,
containing the mortal remains of his wife and his two children. He was
alone—no funeral, no human creature near him. When he arrived at the
place of interment, he was so weakened by starvation himself, that he
was unable to put a little covering of clay upon the coffins to protect
them. When passing the same road next day, the priest found ravenous,
starved dogs making a horrid meal on the carcasses of this uninterred
family. He hired a man, who dug a grave, in which what may be literally
called their remains were placed. On one occasion, returning through the
gray morning from a night call, he observed a dark mass on the side of
the road. Approaching, he found it to be the dead body of a man. Near
his head lay a raw turnip, with one mouthful bitten from it. In several
of the reports from the Board of Works' inspectors, and other
communications, it was said that as the Famine progressed, the people
lost all their natural vivacity. They looked upon themselves as doomed;
and this feeling was expressed by their whole bearing. The extent to
which it prevailed amongst all classes is well illustrated by a
circumstance related by the same clergyman. When the Famine had somewhat
abated in intensity, he was one day in a field which was separated from
the public road by a wall. He heard a voice on the road; it was that of
a peasant girl humming a song. The tears rushed to his eyes. He walked
quickly towards her, searching meantime for some coin to give her. He
placed a shilling in her hand, with a feeling somewhat akin to
enthusiasm. "It was," said he to the author, "the first joyous sound I
had heard for six months."</p>
<p>From Roscommon the brief, but terrible, tidings came that whole
families, who had retired to rest at night, were corpses in the morning;
and were frequently left unburied for many days, for want of coffins in
which to inter them. And the report adds: The state of our poorhouse is
awful; the average daily deaths in it, from fever alone, is eighteen;
<a id="Page_380"></a>there are upwards of eleven hundred inmates in it, and of these six
hundred are in typhus fever.<a href="#Footnote_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222" class="pginternal">[222]</a> In a circumference of eight miles from
where I write, says a correspondent of the <i>Roscommon Journal</i>, not less
than sixty bodies have been interred without a coffin. In answer to
queries sent to a part of Roscommon, I received the following replies
from a reliable source: <i>Query</i>. "What other relief was given during the
Government works by private charity, committees, etc.?" <i>Answer</i>. "There
was considerable relief given by charitable committees." <i>Query</i>. "What
did the wealthy resident landlords give<i>?" Answer</i>. "Considerable."
<i>Query</i>. "What did the wealthy non-resident landlords give?" Again the
answer was, "Considerable." But I am sorry to add that the two latter
queries were almost uniformly answered from various parts of the country
by the expressive words, "Nothing whatever." The same correspondent
said, in reply to another query, that the aged and infirm did not live
more than a day or two after being sent to hospital. They died of
dysentery. The two following anecdotes are given on the best authority:
a family, consisting of father, mother, and daughter, were starving;
they were devotedly attached to each other; the daughter was young and
comely. Offers of relief were made by a wealthy person, but they were
accompanied by a dishonourable condition, and they were therefore
indignantly spurned. Fond as I am of my life, said the starving girl,
and much as I love my father and mother, for whose relief I would endure
any earthly toil, I will suffer them as well as myself to die, rather
than get them relief at the price of my virtue. A Roscommon man thus
writes in the query sheet sent to him: "Years after the Famine, and when
in another part of the country, I was obliged, on my way to my house, to
pass the house of a poor blacksmith; and often at night, as I passed, I
heard him and his family <a id="Page_381"></a>reciting the Rosary. I told him one day how
much edified I was at this. The poor fellow replied with great
earnestness: 'Sir, as long as I have life in me I'll say the Rosary, and
I'll tell you why. In the Famine times, my family and myself were
starving. One night the children were crying with the hunger, and there
was no food to give them. By way of stopping their cries they were put
to bed, but, after a short sleep, they awoke with louder cries for food.
At length, I recommended that all of us, young and old, should join in
saying the Rosary. We did; and before it was ended a woman came in,
whose occupation was to deal in bread, and she had a basketful with her.
I explained our condition to her, and asked her to give me some bread on
credit. She did so, and from that day to this we never felt hunger or
starvation; and from that day to this I continue to say the Rosary, and
will, please God, to the end of my life.'"</p>
<p>The news came from Sligo, through the public journals, that the Famine
was carrying off hundreds and thousands there, and that the work left
undone by the Famine would be finished by pestilence. The Workhouse was
described as a pesthouse, and the guardians in terror had abandoned it.
The following short note will give a better idea of the state of this
part of the country than any lengthened description:—</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="right">"<i>Riverston, 8th Feb</i>.</p>
<p>"SIR,—<i>Half-a-dozen</i> starvation deaths have been reported to Mr. Grant
this evening, and he directs me to write to you to request you will
attend here early to-morrow morning to hold inquests.</p>
<p class="right">"JAMES HAY, <i>Head Constable</i>.</p>
<p>"Alexander Burrows, Esq."</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But things were much worse than was revealed by this note. Mr. Burrows
was quite unequal to the work he had to do. In one day, although he
tired three horses, he <a id="Page_382"></a>succeeded in holding only five inquests. Poor
progress indeed, inasmuch as there were FORTY dead bodies in the
district of Managharrow alone, awaiting him! One of the cases, that of
Owen Mulrooney, was a moving one. He was a young, muscular man, in the
prime of life. He had a wife and five young children. Here is the
substance of his wife's depositions at the inquest held upon his
remains. She sold all her little furniture for ten shillings, and with
this sum she and her five children left home to make her way to England,
as she thought her husband would be able to support himself, if
unencumbered by her and the family. The weather became cold and rainy;
and when she had got as far as Enniskillen, the children took cramps,
and she had to retrace her steps by slow degrees, and seek again her
desolate home. Meantime, the public works, upon which her husband had
been employed, were stopped, and he was at once reduced to starvation. A
neighbour gave him one meal of food and a night's lodging. He was
revived by the food, and had strength enough to make up two loads of
turf, which he sold, and bought an ass, which he killed, and tried to
cook and eat. He partook of some portion of the ass's flesh twice or
thrice, but his stomach refused the food, as it always brought on great
retching. When his wife and children returned he was dying, and she was
only in time to see him, and give the above sorrowful evidence. We
select this case, said the local journal, out of dozens; because it has
some remarkable features in it. Many, it further adds, who were sent to
purchase food, died of starvation on the journey. The family of Mary
Costello were in a state of starvation for three weeks, and she herself
had not had food for two days. Previous to her death, one of her
brothers procured the price of half-a-stone of meal, for which she was
sent to town; and on the following morning she was found dead by the
roadside, with the little bag of meal grasped tightly in her hand.</p>
<p>Although it is notorious that some districts in the South, <a id="Page_383"></a>especially
Skibbereen, were the first to attract a large share of public attention,
the county Mayo, so populous, so large, so poor, was from the beginning
marked out for suffering; but it lacked an organ so faithful and
eloquent as the <i>Southern Reporter</i>, through whose columns Skibbereen
and Bantry and Skull became as well known to the Empire as Dublin,
Paris, or London. Poor Mayo suffered intensely from end to end, although
it suffered in comparative silence. In the beginning of January, what
may be termed a monster meeting of the county was held in Westport.
Forty thousand persons were said to have assembled on the occasion. The
Very Rev. Dean Burke, who presided, complained that, as far back as
September, a presentment of £80,000 was passed for the county, £12,000
of which was allotted to their barony, Murrisk; but from that time to
the period of the meeting only £7,000 had been expended. Resolutions
were passed, calling for a liberal grant of money to save the people
from death; expressive of deep regret at the uncultured state of the
corn lands of the county; calling for the establishment of food depôts
in the remote districts; and recommending the completion of the roads
then in progress. More than one speaker hinted that there existed an
under current for preventing the employment of the people, and that this
under current emanated from the landlords, who were opposed to the
taxing of their properties for such a purpose. At the close of the
meeting, one of the gentlemen present, Mr. John C. Garvey, made the
following observations:—"It has been said that an under current exists
to prevent the employment of the people. In my opinion the landlords
would be working against their own interest in preventing the employment
of the poor. (Cries of No, no.) Well, I, as one of the landlords, do
declare most solemnly, before my God, that I have not only in public,
but in private, done everything that I could do to extend the employment
<a id="Page_384"></a>of the people (loud cheers); and I now brand every landlord that does
not come forward and clear himself of the imputation."</p>
<p>A great number of coroners' inquests were reported from Mayo, but those
inquests were no real indication of the number of deaths which occurred
there from starvation; there were not coroners enough to hold inquests,
and four-fifths of those that were held were not reported. Besides,
inquests were not, and could not be held unless in cases where the death
was somewhat sudden, or had some specialty about it. The effects of the
Famine were not usually very sudden. People dragged on life for weeks,
partly through that tenacity of life which is one of the characteristics
of human nature; partly through chance scraps of food obtained from time
to time, and in various ways. Families have gone on for many weeks on
boiled turnips, with a little oatmeal sprinkled over them; often on
green rape, and even the wild herbs of the fields and seaweed; such
things kept prolonging life whilst they were destroying it. After a
while they brought on dysentery: dysentery—death. But no one thought of
a coroner in such cases, which were by far the most numerous class of
cases until fever became prevalent, and even then dysentery commonly
came in to close the scene.</p>
<p>"During that period," writes Mr. James H. Tuke, "the roads in many
places became as charnel-houses, and several car and coach drivers have
assured me that they rarely drove anywhere without seeing dead bodies
strewn along the road side, and that, in the dark, they had even gone
over them. A gentleman told me that in the neighbourhood of Clifden one
Inspector of roads had caused no less than 140 bodies to be buried,
which he found scattered along the highway. In some cases it is well
known that where all other members of a family have perished, the last
survivor has earthed up the door of his miserable <a id="Page_385"></a>cabin to prevent the
ingress of pigs and dogs, and then laid himself down to die in this
fearful family vault."<a href="#Footnote_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223" class="pginternal">[223]</a></p>
<p>In January, 1847, a Protestant gentleman, now a colonial judge, well
known for his ability and integrity, gave, through the columns of a
Dublin newspaper, an account of the state of Mayo as he saw it. He found
great dissatisfaction—in fact indignation, existing with regard to the
unaccountable delay of the public works, which had been presented for in
that county; and this not merely amongst the starving people, but
amongst the most respectable and intelligent persons with whom he
conversed. He—a man not likely to take a narrow or prejudiced view of
any subject—was of opinion that those complaints were not groundless.
The officials, he says, instead of extending the works in Mayo, and
feeding the people, "are employed in diverting public attention by
prating of subscriptions, paltering about Queen's letters and English
poor-boxes, and frittering away the strength of public opinion and the
efficiency of all public action, by engaging private charity in a task
that can be met only by the Herculean efforts of a whole nation, knit
into a single power, and bound into concentrated exertion by all the
constraining forces that the constitution of political society
affords."<a href="#Footnote_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224" class="pginternal">[224]</a> And then the starving people are blamed for finding
fault, and for being suspicious. What else, he asks, can they be? How
can a man dying of starvation have patience?</p>
<p>The chief places he visited were Balla, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis, and
Hollymount. The scenes he witnessed were, he says, scarcely if at all
less harrowing than those which had been reported from the locality of
Skibbereen. <a id="Page_386"></a>This writer, a Protestant, conversed, amongst others, with
the priests of the districts which he visited, and of them he says: "The
Catholic clergy are the only persons who can form a tolerably correct
estimate of the numbers of persons who are now dying of starvation. The
Catholic clergy know all the people of their respective parishes—<i>no
one else does</i>; the Catholic priest knows them as the shepherd does his
sheep; he knows them individually; he knows not only every lineament of
every individual face, but he knows, too, every ailment of body—every
care of mind—every necessity of circumstance from which he is
suffering. The Catholic clergy of the West attend every death-bed: the
poor there are all Catholics. The Catholic clergy know, then, to what it
is that the extraordinary mortality now prevalent is owing—<i>and they
set it down as the immediate consequence of want and starvation</i>."<a href="#Footnote_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225" class="pginternal">[225]</a></p>
<p>One of the priests of whom W.G. asked information told him his whole
time, and that of his assistant, was unceasingly occupied in
administering the last comforts of religion to the victims of
starvation. It would, he said, be an endless task, and he feared a
useless one, to record his sad experiences.</p>
<p>People died in Connaught whilst in full employment on the public works,
just as they did in Munster. Of such cases, the following is one of
which W.G. collected some particulars:—James Byrne, of Barnabriggan,
Brize, parish of Balla, was employed up to his death on the public
works. The last food of which he had partaken was obtained by his wife
pledging her cloak. There was an inquest upon this poor man's remains,
at which his wife deposed that up to the time of his death he was
employed on the public works, and as they had no food she was obliged to
pledge her cloak for one stone of meal. Deceased often said he would do
well if he had food or nourishment. <a id="Page_387"></a>Deponent states to the best of her
belief that her husband died for the want of food. She and her four
children are now living on rape, which she is allowed to gather in a
farmer's field. James Browne, Esq., M.D., being sworn, said he found, on
examination, all the internal organs of the deceased sound. There was no
food whatever in his stomach, or in any part of the alimentary canal.
There was a small quantity of thin faeces in the lower portion of the
large intestine. Is of opinion that deceased came by his death from
inanition, or want of food. Verdict: "James Byrne came by his death in
consequence of having no food for some days; and died of starvation."</p>
<p>"With every disposition," writes W.G., "to make allowances for the
difficulties of their position, let me ask, Sir, how have the gentry
acted? They have seemed to think that the whole relief question just
split itself into two sides, one of which belonged exclusively to the
Government, the other exclusively to them. One side comprised the duty
of providing for the lives of the people, and this was left to the
Government; the other, the duty of providing for the safety of the
estates, and this the gentry took upon themselves." "They [the
landlords] have complained much of the character of the works; they have
strongly urged the Government to undertake something else; <i>at all
events to give up what they were doing at the moment</i>; but when did
their indignation take the shape of complaining that what the Government
was doing was inadequate for coping with the starvation that was
abroad?"</p>
<p>The penetrating mind of W.G. led him to forecast tremendous results from
the potato failure, exclusive of its immediate effect—death by
starvation. Having expressed his opinion that the extent of the
destitution was fearful, he makes the following observations, which time
has completely verified. "As regards the effect," says he, "of the
present calamity upon the relations of landlord and tenant, <a id="Page_388"></a>believe me,
that terrible as are the immediate and direct effects of the calamity,
you will find a set of collateral results springing out of it, tending
to the EXTERMINATION of the smaller tenantry by the landlords, that may
lead you, ere many months, to regard the secondary stage of this scourge
as scarcely less terrible to our unhappy peasantry than the first." And
again: "Symptoms of a WIDE-SPREAD SYSTEMATIC EXTERMINATION are just
beginning to exhibit themselves. I am not speaking under the influence
of any prejudice against the landlord class. Let none of your readers
set down to the account of such a feeling my present warning as to the
wholesale system of ejectment that is now in preparation." "The potato
cultivation being extinguished, at least for a time, the peasant
cultivators can pay no rents; sheep and horned cattle <i>can</i> pay rents,
and smart rents too; therefore the sheep and cattle shall have the
lands, and the peasants shall be ousted from them; a very simple and
most inevitable conclusion, as you see." "I repeat it, a universal
system of ousting the peasantry is about to set in. Whether this results
from the fault or from the necessities of the landlords it matters not."
The following extract from the <i>Roscommon Journal</i> is emphatically cited
by W.G. in support of his views. "<i>The number of civil bills served by
landlords for the approaching sessions of this town</i> WILL TREBLE THOSE
EVER SENT OUT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS."<a href="#Footnote_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226" class="pginternal">[226]</a></p>
<p><a id="Page_389"></a>More than twenty years after W.G. wrote those letters, I had a
conversation relative to the Famine with a gentleman who knew the
Midland Counties and portions of the West well. I asked him what was the
effect of the Famine in his district. "My district," he answered, "was
by no means regarded as a poor one, but the Famine swept away more than
half its population. The census of '41 gave the families residing in it
as 2,200; the census of '51 gave them at 1,000." Did the landlords, I
enquired, come forward liberally to save the lives of the people? "Only
one landlord," he replied, "in the whole locality with which I am
connected did anything to save the people, F—— O'B——. He asked no
rent for two years, and he never afterwards insisted on the rent of
those two years; although I must say he was paid it by many of his
tenants, of their own free will; but, for the rest, he cancelled those
two years' rent and opened a new account with them, as with men owing
him nothing." And what, I further asked, were the feelings of the
landlords with regard to their tenants dying of starvation? He answered
with solemn emphasis—"DELIGHTED TO BE RID OF THEM."</p>
<p>The present leader of the Conservative party seems to entertain feelings
akin to this; for, some years ago, addressing his constituents, and
speaking of some results of the Irish Famine, he said
significantly—"there are worse things than a famine."</p>
<p>"I shall never forget," said Rev. Mr. F—— to W.G., "the impression
made on my mind a few days ago by a <a id="Page_390"></a>most heartrending case of
starvation. It was this: The poor mother of five children, putting them
to bed one night, almost lifeless from hunger, and despairing of ever
again seeing them alive, took her last look at them, and bade them her
last farewell. She rose early in the morning, and her first act was to
steal on tiptoe to where they lay. She would not awake them, but she
must know the truth—are they alive or dead? and she softly touched the
lips of each, to try and discover if there was any warmth in them, and
she eagerly watched to see if the breath of life still came from their
nostrils. Her apprehensions were but too well founded, she had lost some
of her dear ones during the night."</p>
<p>The mournful poetry of this simple narrative must touch every heart.</p>
<p>Ass and horse flesh were anxiously sought for, even when the animals
died of disease or starvation. In the middle of January it was recorded
that a horse belonging to a man near Claremorris, having died, was
flayed, and the carcass left for dogs and birds to feed upon; but, says
the narrative, before much of it was consumed, it was discovered by a
poor family (whose name and residence are given), and by them used as
food. Father, mother and six children prolonged life for a week upon
this disgusting carrion, and even regretted the loss of it, when the
supply failed; and the poor mother said to the person who made the fact
public, "the Lord only knows what I will now do for my starving
children, since it is gone!" A fortnight earlier a most circumstantial
account of the eating of ass flesh is given by a commercial gentleman in
a letter addressed to the Premier, Lord John Russell, and dated
"Ballina, Christmas-eve." (!) In this case the poor man killed his ass
for food, the skin being sold to a skin dealer for 8d. The writer of the
letter visited the skin dealer's house, in order to make sure of the
fact. It was quite true, and the skin dealer's wife told him this could
not be a solitary case, "<a id="Page_391"></a>as she never remembered so many asses' skins
coming for sale as within the month just past."<a href="#Footnote_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227" class="pginternal">[227]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Forster, in his report to the Society of Friends, says of the
condition of Westport in January, 1847, that it was a strange and
fearful sight, like what we read of beleaguered cities; its streets
crowded with gaunt wanderers, sauntering to and fro, with hopeless air
and hunger-struck look; a mob of starved, almost naked women were around
the poorhouse, clamouring for soup-tickets; our inn, the head-quarters
of the road engineer and pay clerks, was beset by a crowd of beggars for
work.<a href="#Footnote_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228" class="pginternal">[228]</a> The agent of the British Association, Count Strezelecki,
writing from Westport at this time, says, no pen could describe the
distress by which he was surrounded; it had reached such an extreme
degree of intensity that it was above the power of exaggeration. You
may, he adds, believe anything which you hear and read, because what I
actually see surpasses what I ever read of past and present
calamities.<a href="#Footnote_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229" class="pginternal">[229]</a></p>
<p>The weather in March became mild, and even warm and sunny; some little
comfort, one would suppose, to those without food or fuel. But no; they
were so starved and weakened and broken down, that it had an injurious
effect <a id="Page_392"></a>upon them, and hurried them rapidly to their end. A week after
the passage quoted above was written, Count Strezelecki again writes,
and says he is sorry to report that the distress had increased; a thing
which could be hardly believed as possible. Melancholy cases of death on
the public roads and in the streets had become more frequent. The sudden
warmth of the weather, and the rays of a bright sun, accelerate
prodigiously the forthcoming end of those whose constitutions are
undermined by famine or sickness. "Yesterday," he writes, "a
countrywoman, between this and the harbour (one mile distance), walking
with four children, squatted against a wall, on which the heat and light
reflected powerfully; some hours after two of her children were corpses,
and she and the two remaining ones taken lifeless to the barracks.
To-day, in Westport, similar melancholy occurrences took place."<a href="#Footnote_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230" class="pginternal">[230]</a></p>
<p>Some years ago, during a visit to Westport, I received sad corroboration
of the truth of these statements. I met several persons who had
witnessed the Famine in that town and its neighbourhood, and their
relation of the scenes which fell under their notice not only sustained,
but surpassed, if possible, the facts given in the above communications.
A priest who was stationed at Westport during the Famine, was still
there at the period of my visit. During that dreadful time, the people,
he told me, who wandered about the country in search of food, frequently
took possession of empty houses, which they easily found; the inmates
having died, or having gone to the Workhouse, where such existed. A
brother and sister, not quite grown up, took possession of a house in
this way, in the Parish of Westport. One of them became ill; the other
continued to go for the relief where it was given out, but this one soon
fell ill also. No person heeded them. Everyone had too much to do for
himself. They died. Their dead bodies <a id="Page_393"></a>were only discovered by the
offensive odour which issued from the house in which they died, and in
which they had become putrefied. It was found necessary to make an
aperture for ventilation on the roof before anyone would venture in. The
neighbours dug a hole in the hard floor of the cabin with a crowbar to
receive their remains. And this was their coffinless grave!</p>
<p>This same priest administered in one day the last Sacrament to
thirty-three young persons in the Workhouse of Westport; and of these
there were not more than two or three alive next morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Egan, who at the date of my visit was Clerk of the Union, held the
same office during the Famine. The Workhouse was built to accommodate
one thousand persons. There were two days a-week for admissions. With
the house crowded far beyond its capacity, he had repeatedly seen as
many as three thousand persons seeking admission on a single day.
Knowing, as we do, the utter dislike the Irish peasantry had in those
times to enter the Workhouse, this is a terrible revelation of the
Famine; for it is a recorded fact that many of the people died of want
in their cabins, and suffered their children to die, rather than go
there. Those who were not admitted—and they were, of course, the great
majority—having no homes to return to, lay down and died in Westport
and its suburbs. Mr. Egan, pointing to the wall opposite the Workhouse
gate, said: "There is where they sat down, never to rise again. I have
seen there of a morning as many as eight corpses of those miserable
beings, who had died during the night. Father G—— (then in Westport)
used to be anointing them as they lay exhausted along the walls and
streets, dying of hunger and fever."<a href="#Footnote_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231" class="pginternal">[231]</a></p>
<p>The principal aim of the Society of Friends was to establish
soup-kitchens, and give employment to the <a id="Page_394"></a>women in knitting. As soon as
their committee was in working order, they sent members of their body to
various parts of the country—more especially to the West—to make
inquiries, and to see things with their own eyes. Their reports, made in
a quiet, unexaggerated form, are amongst the most valuable testimonies
extant, as to the effects and extent of the Famine. The delegate who was
the first to explore portions of the West writes that, at Boyle (a
prosperous and important town), the persons who sought admission to the
Workhouse were in a most emaciated state, many of them declaring that
they had not tasted food of any kind for forty-eight hours; and he
learned that numbers of them had been living upon turnips and
cabbage-leaves for weeks. The truth of these statements was but too well
supported by the dreadfully reduced state in which they presented
themselves, the children especially being emaciated with starvation, and
ravenous with hunger. At Carrick-on-Shannon he witnessed what he calls a
most painful and heartrending scene—poor wretches in the last stage of
famine begging to be received into the house; women, who had six or
seven children, imploring that even two or three of them might be taken
in, <i>as their husbands were earning but 8d. a-day</i>, which, at the
existing high price of provisions, was totally inadequate to feed them.
Some of those children were worn to skeletons; their features sharpened
with hunger, and their limbs wasted almost to the bone. Of course, he
says, among so many applicants (one hundred and ten), a great number
were necessarily refused admittance, as there were but thirty vacancies
in the house. Although the guardians exercised the best discrimination
they could, it was believed that some of those rejected were so far
spent, that it was doubtful if they could reach their homes alive—those
homes, such as they were, being in many cases five or six Irish miles
away. This kind-hearted gentleman, having expressed a wish to distribute
bread to those poor creatures, <a id="Page_395"></a>that they might not, as he said, "go
quite empty-handed," forty pounds of bread were procured, all that could
be purchased in the town of Carrick-on-Shannon. They devoured it with a
voracity which nothing but famine could produce. One woman, he says, was
observed to eat but a very small portion of her bread; and being asked
the reason, said she had four children at home, to whom she was taking
it, as without it there would not be a morsel of food in her cabin that
night. What struck him and his fellow-traveller in a special manner was
the effects of famine on the children; their faces were so wan and
haggard that they looked like old men and women; their sprightliness was
all gone; they sat in groups at their cabin doors, making no attempt to
play. Another indication of the Famine noticed by them was, that the
pigs and poultry had entirely disappeared. To numberless testimonies, as
to the spirit in which the poor people bore their unexampled privations,
this good man adds his: "To do the poor justice," he writes, "they are
bearing their privations with a remarkable degree of patience and
fortitude, and very little clamorous begging is to be met with upon the
roads—at least, not more than has been the case in Ireland for many
years. William Forster," (his fellow-traveller), he adds, "has
completely formed the opinion that the statements in the public
newspapers are by no means exaggerated."<a href="#Footnote_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232" class="pginternal">[232]</a></p>
<p>Although Donegal is in the Ulster division of the kingdom, in the famine
time it partook more of the character of a Connaught than an Ulster
county. A gentleman was deputed by the Society of Friends to explore it,
who has given his views upon the Irish Famine with a spirit and feeling
which do him honour as a man and a Christian. Writing from Stranorlar he
says: "This county, like most others in Ireland, belongs to a few large
proprietors, some <a id="Page_396"></a>of them, unhappily, absentees, whose large domains
sometimes extend over whole parishes and baronies, and contain a
population of 8,000 to 12,000. Such, for instance, is the parish of
Templecrone, with a population of 10,000 inhabitants; in which the only
residents above small farmers are, the agent, the protestant clergyman,
the parish priest, a medical man, and perhaps a resident magistrate,
with the superintendent of police and a few small dealers.<a href="#Footnote_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233" class="pginternal">[233]</a> Writing
from Dunfanaghy in the midst of snow, he says: "A portion of the
district through which we passed this day, as well as the adjoining one,
is, with one exception, the poorest and most destitute in Donegal.
Nothing, indeed, can describe too strongly the dreadful condition of the
people. Many families were living on a single meal of cabbage, and some
even, as we were assured, upon a little seaweed." A highly respectable
merchant of the town called upon this gentleman and assured him that the
small farmers and cottiers had parted with all their pigs and their
fowl; and even their bed clothes and fishing nets had gone for the same
object, the supply of food. He stated that he knew many families of five
to eight persons, who subsisted on 2½ lbs. of oatmeal per day, made
into thin water gruel—about 6 oz. of meal for each! Dunfanaghy is a
little fishing town situated on a bay remarkably adapted for a fishing
population; the sea is teeming with fish of the finest description,
waiting, we might say, to be caught. Many of the inhabitants gain a
portion of their living by this means, but so rude is their tackle, and
so fragile and liable to be upset are their primitive boats or
<i>coracles</i>, made of wicker-work, over which sailcloth is stretched, that
they can only venture to sea in fine weather; and thus with food almost
in sight, the people starve, because they have no one to teach them to
build boats more adapted to this rocky coast than those used by their
ancestors many centuries <a id="Page_397"></a>ago.<a href="#Footnote_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234" class="pginternal">[234]</a> This is but one among many instances
of the wasted industrial resources of this country which, whether in
connection with the water or the land, strike the eye of the stranger at
every step."<a href="#Footnote_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235" class="pginternal">[235]</a></p>
<p>To Glenties Mr. Tuke and his companions made their journey through a
succession of wild mountain passes, rendered still wilder by the deep
snow which covered everything. They put up at Lord George Hill's
Gweedore hotel, and endorse all they had previously heard about the
admirable zeal and enlightened benevolence of that nobleman, who had
effected great improvements both in the land and in the condition of the
inhabitants of one of the wildest portions of Donegal. "We started at
daybreak," he writes, "for Glenties, thirty miles distant, over the
mountains; and after leaving the improved cottages and farms on the
Gweedore estate, soon came upon the domain of an absentee proprietor,
the extent of which may be judged by the fact, that our road lay for
more than twenty miles through it. This is the poorest parish in
Donegal, and no statement can be too strong with respect to the wretched
condition, the positive misery and starvation in which the cottiers and
small farmers on this immense domain are found. We baited at Dungloe. A
more miserable and dilapidated village or town I never saw. What a
contrast did its dirty little inn present to the hotel at Gweedore."
There was not a single pound of meal, Indian or oat, to be purchased in
this miserable place, whilst thousands were depending on it for their
supplies. It was crowded with poor people from the surrounding country
and from the island of Arranmore, who were crying with hunger and <a id="Page_398"></a>cold;
the next market town was thirty miles from them, and the nearest place
where food could be obtained was Lord George Hill's store at Bunbeg,
some twenty miles distant. Surely this extreme wretchedness and neglect
must be, to a great extent, attributed to the want of a resident
proprietor.</p>
<p>"Leaving Dungloe," says Mr. Tuke, "we proceeded to Glenties, still on
the same property; and throughout our journey met with the most squalid
scenes of misery which the imagination can well conceive. Whilst
thousands of acres of reclaimable land lies entirely neglected and
uncultivated, there are thousands of men both willing and anxious to
obtain work, but unable to procure it. On the following morning, William
Forster had an interview with the resident magistrate, as well as with
the rector of the parish and some other gentlemen, who gave distressing
accounts of the poverty existing around them. Their attention was
directed to the necessity for the immediate establishment of
soup-kitchens, the employment of women in knitting, and the formation of
local committees for their relief, extending over several parishes. We
visited the poorhouse at Glenties, which is in a dreadful state; the
people were in fact half starved and only half clothed. The day before,
they had but one meal of oatmeal and water; and at the time of our visit
had not sufficient food in the house for the day's supply. The people
complained bitterly, as well they might, and begged us to give them
tickets for work, to enable them to leave the place and work on the
roads. Some were leaving the house, preferring to die in their own
hovels rather than in the Poorhouse. Their bedding consisted of dirty
straw, in which they were laid in rows on the floor; even as many as six
persons being crowded under one rug; and we did not see a blanket at
all. The rooms were hardly bearable for filth. The living and the dying
were stretched side by side beneath the same miserable covering! No
wonder that disease and pestilence were <a id="Page_399"></a>filling the infirmary, and that
the pale haggard countenances of the poor boys and girls told of
sufferings which it was impossible to contemplate without the deepest
commiseration and pity."</p>
<p>The carelessness and neglect of their duty by Irish landlords have so
often come before us during the progress of the Famine, that it is a
pleasure to meet with something worth quoting on the other side.
"Throughout Donegal we found," says Mr. Tuke, "the resident proprietors
doing much for their suffering tenantry; in many cases, all that
landlords could do for their relief and assistance. Several of them had
obtained loans under the late Drainage Act, and with this or private
resources are employing large numbers of labourers for the improvement
of their estates. We met with several who had one hundred men employed
in this manner. Many of these landlords, as well as the clergy, are most
assiduously working in all ways in their power. They have imported large
quantities of meal and rice, which they sell at prime cost, there being
in many districts no dealers to supply those articles; and are making
soup at their own houses, and dispensing daily to their famishing
neighbours."<a href="#Footnote_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236" class="pginternal">[236]</a></p>
<p>In the South, after Skibbereen, Skull, its neighbour, seems to have
suffered most. To cross from Cape Clear to Skull—partly rowing, partly
sailing—in a stiff breeze is very exciting, and might well cause
apprehension, but for the crew of athletic Cape men, or Capers, as the
people of the mainland call them, in whose hands you have placed your
safety. With them you are perfectly secure. Those hardy, simple-minded
people are as used to the sea as a herdsman is to green fields. Even
when they are not actually upon its stormy bosom, they are usually to be
seen in groups about the little harbour, leaning against the rocks,
quietly smoking their pipes, watching the tide and <a id="Page_400"></a>the weather, and
discussing the proper moment for "going out." It is some five miles from
Cape Clear to the town of Skull. The distance is not long, but without
skill and local knowledge the passage is dangerous, for what seems only
a light gale elsewhere makes the sea almost tempestuous among the bluffs
and rocky islands of this wild coast, where many a foundering barque has
been rescued from destruction by the brave and trusty oarsmen of Cape
Clear. Leaving Roaring-water bay to the north-east, and getting in
shelter of the land, a church tower, humble in design and proportions,
rises in the midst of a graveyard, crowded in one part with tombstones,
and almost entirely devoid of them in the other. There rest the mortal
remains of many generations of the people of Skull; but it is especially
worthy of notice as the burial-ground which had to be doubled in size in
order to receive upwards of half the population within its bosom in a
single year; and yet all were not interred there: many found a grave in
the fields nearest to which they died; many others, among the ruins of
their dismantled cabins. This graveyard, looking out upon the restless
waters from its quiet elevation, must remain for ages the most historic
spot in the locality, although Skull is not without a history and
historic remains. Many a castle and stronghold have the O'Mahonys and
O'Donovans built among the crags of the rocky islands, which are grouped
in such variety to seaward, the ruins of which are to-day full of
interest and beauty for the tourist. But surely the day will come when
those crumbling ruins shall be once again a portion of the common soil,
nameless and forgotten; but distant though that day may be, Skull and
Skibbereen, those two famine-slain sisters of the South, must still be
found on the page of Irish history, illustrating the Great Famine of
1847.</p>
<p>The parish of Skull is situated in the barony of West Carberry, county
of Cork, and is very large, containing no less than 84,000 acres. The
town, a small one, is on the <a id="Page_401"></a>shore in the portion of the parish called
East Skull; West Skull runs inland towards Skibbereen, and in this
division is the village of Ballydehob. The town of Skull is built upon a
piece of low level ground, a short distance from which, in the direction
of Ballydehob, there is a chain of hills, the highest of which, Mount
Gabriel, rises 1,300 feet above the sea level. Nothing can be happier or
more accurate than the poet's description of this scenery, when he
writes:—</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div>The summer sun is falling soft on Carbery's hundred isles,</div>
<div>The summer sun is gleaming still through Gabriel's rough defiles."<a href="#Footnote_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237" class="pginternal">[237]</a></div></div>
</div>
<p>A correspondent of the <i>Southern Reporter</i>, writing from Ballydehob
during the first days of January, gives the most piteous account of that
village; every house he entered exhibited the same characteristics,—no
clothing, no food, starvation in the looks of young and old. In a
tumble-down cabin resembling a deserted forge, he found a miserable man
seated at a few embers, with a starved-looking dog beside him, that was
not able to crawl. The visitor asked him if he were sick; he answered
that he was not, but having got swelled legs working on the roads, he
had to give up; he had not tasted food for two days; his family had gone
begging about the country, and he had no hope of ever seeing them again.
Efforts were still being made at this place to get coffins for the dead,
but with indifferent success. There were not coffins for half the
people; many were tied up in straw, and so interred. This writer
mentions what he seems to have regarded as an ingenious contrivance of
the Galeen relief committee, namely, the use of the coffin with the
slide or hinged bottom, but such coffins had been, previously used in
other places. He relates a touching incident which occurred at
Ballydehob, at the time of his visit. Two children, the elder only six
<a id="Page_402"></a>years, went into a neighbour's house in search of food. They were asked
where their father was, and they replied that he was asleep for the last
two days. The people became alarmed, and went to his cabin, where they
found him quite dead, and the merest skeleton. The mother of those
children had died some weeks before, and their poor devoted father
sacrificed his life for them, as the neighbours found some Indian meal
in the place, which he was evidently reserving for his infant children,
whilst he suffered himself to die of starvation.</p>
<p>But a common effect of the Famine was to harden the hearts of the
people, and blunt their natural feelings. Hundreds, remarks this
correspondent, are daily expiring in their cabins in the three parishes
of this neighbourhood, and the people are becoming so accustomed to
death that they have lost all those kindly sympathies for the relatives
of the departed, which formerly characterized their natures. Want and
destitution have so changed them, that a sordid avarice, and a
greediness of disposition to grasp at everything in the shape of food,
has seized hold of the souls of those who were considered the most
generous and hospitable race on the face of the earth. As happened in
other places, no persons attended the funerals; those who were still
alive were so exhausted that they were unable to inter the dead, and the
duty of doing so was frequently left to casual passers-by.</p>
<p>About the middle of February, Commander Caffin, of Her Majesty's ship
"Scourge," visited Skull, in company with the rector, the Rev. Robert
Traill Hall. After having entered a few houses, the Commander said to
the Revd. gentleman, "My pre-conceived ideas of your misery seem as a
dream to me compared with the reality." And yet Captain Caffin had only
time to see the cabins on the roadside, in which the famine was not so
terrible as it was up among the hills and fastnesses, where, in one
wretched hovel, whose two windows were stuffed with straw, the <a id="Page_403"></a>Rev. Mr.
Hall found huddled together sixteen human beings. They did not, however,
belong to one family—three wretched households were congregated into
this miserable abode. Out of the sixteen, two only could be said to be
able to work; and on the exertions of those "two poor pallid objects"
had the rest to depend. Eight of the others were crowded into one
pallet,—it could not be called a bed, being formed of a little straw,
which scarcely kept them from the cold mud floor. A poor father was
still able to sit up, but his legs were dreadfully swollen, and he was
dead in two or three days after the Rev. Mr. Hall's visit. Beside him
lay his sister, and at his feet two children—all hastening to eternity.</p>
<p>Captain Caffin wrote to a friend an account of his visit to Skull, and
his letter was published in many of the public journals. "In the village
of Skull," he says, "three-fourths of the inhabitants you meet carry the
tale of woe in their features and persons, as they are reduced to mere
skeletons, the men in particular, all their physical power wasted away;
they have all become beggars. Having a great desire to see with my own
eyes some of the misery which was said to exist, Dr. Traill, the rector
of Skull, offered to drive me to a portion of his parish. I found there
was no need to take me beyond the village, to show me the horrors of
famine in its worst features. I had read in the papers letters and
accounts of this state of things, but I thought they must be highly
coloured to attract sympathy; but I there saw the reality of the
whole—no exaggeration, for it does not admit of it—famine exists to a
fearful degree, with all its horrors. Fever has sprung up consequent
upon the wretchedness; and swellings of limbs and body, and diarrhoea,
from the want of nourishment, are everywhere to be found." Again: "In no
house that I entered was there not to be found the dead or dying; in
particularizing two or three they may be taken as the picture of the
whole—there was no picking or choosing, <a id="Page_404"></a>but we took them just as they
came." A cabin which he entered had, he says, the appearance of
wretchedness without, but its interior was misery. The Rev. Mr. Hall, on
putting his head inside the hole which answered for a door, said: "Well,
Phillis, how is your mother to-day?" Phillis answered, "O Sir, is it
you? Mother is dead." Captain Caffin adds—"And there—fearful
reality—was the daughter, a skeleton herself, crouched and crying over
the lifeless body of her mother, which was on the floor, cramped up as
she had died, with her rags and her cloak about her, by the side of a
few embers of peat." They came to the cabin of a poor old woman, the
door of which was stopped up with dung. She roused up, evidently
astonished. They had taken her by surprise. She burst into tears, and
said she had not been able to sleep <i>since the corpse of the woman had
lain in her bed</i>. The circumstance which destroyed her rest happened in
this way:—Some short time before, a poor miserable woman entered the
cabin, and asked leave to rest herself for a few moments. She got
permission to do so. She lay down, but never rose again. She died in an
hour, and in this miserable hovel of six feet square, the body remained
four days before the wretched occupant could get any person to remove
it. It is not much to be wondered at that she had lost her rest.</p>
<p>"I could," says Captain Caffin, "in this manner take you through thirty
or more cottages that we visited, but they, without exception, were all
alike—the dead and the dying in each; and I could tell you more of the
truth of the heartrending scene, were I to mention the lamentations and
bitter cries of each of those poor creatures, on the threshold of death.
Never in my life have I seen such wholesale misery, nor could I have
thought it so complete. All that I have stated above," he concludes, "I
have seen with my own eyes, and can vouch for the truth of. And I feel I
cannot convey by words the impression left on my mind of this awful
state of things. I could tell you also <a id="Page_405"></a>of that which I could vouch for
the truth of, but which I did not see myself, such as bodies half eaten
by the rats; of two dogs last Wednesday being shot by Mr. O'Callaghan
whilst tearing a body to pieces; of his mother-in-law stopping a poor
woman and asking her what she had on her back, and being replied it was
her son, telling her she would smother it; but the poor emaciated woman
said it was dead already, and she was going to dig a hole in the
churchyard for it. These are things which are of every-day
occurrence."<a href="#Footnote_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238" class="pginternal">[238]</a></p>
<p>Taking Ballydehob as a centre, there were, at this time, in a radius of
ten or twelve miles around it, twenty-six soup kitchens—namely, at
Skibbereen, Baltimore, Shirken, and Cape Clear (three); Creagh,
Castlehaven (two); Union Hall, Aghadown (two); Kilcoe (three); Skull
(two); Dunmanus, Crookhaven (two); Cahiragh (two); Durrus, Drimoleague,
Drenagh, Bantry, Glengariff, Adrigoole, Castletown, Berehaven, and
Ballydehob. They were making and distributing daily about seventeen
thousand pints of good meat soup. They did great good, but it was of a
very partial nature. Mr. Commissary Bishop tells us "they were but a
drop in the ocean." Hundreds, he says, are relieved, but thousands still
want. And he adds, that soup kitchens have their attendant evils: an
important one in this instance was, that the poor small farmers were
selling all their cows to the soup kitchens, leaving themselves and
their children without milk or butter.</p>
<p>There seems to have been an understanding among the <i>employes</i>, that the
true state of things, in its naked reality, was not to be given in their
communications to Government. It was to be toned down and modified.
Hence the studied avoidance of the word Famine in almost every official
document of the time. Captain Caffin's letter was written to a friend
and marked "private;" but having <a id="Page_406"></a>got into the newspapers, it must, of
course, be taken notice of by the Government. Mr. Trevelyan lost no
time, but at once wrote, enclosing it to Sir John Burgoyne. To use his
own words on the occasion, the receipt, from the Commander of the
Scourge, of "the awful letter, describing the result of his personal
observations in the immediate neighbourhood of Skull," led him (Mr.
Trevelyan) to make two proposals on the part of the Treasury. And
indeed, it must be said, well meant and practical they were. The first
was, to send two half-pay medical officers to Skull, to try and do
something for the sick, many of whom were dying for want of the
commonest care; and also to combine with that arrangement, the means of
securing the decent interment of the dead. The second proposal was to
provide carts, for the conveyance of soup to the sick in their houses in
and around Skull; a most necessary provision, inasmuch as the starving
people were, in numerous cases, unable to walk from their dwellings to
the soup kitchen; besides which, in many houses the whole family were
struck down by a combination of fever, starvation and dysentery. Sir
John Burgoyne, as might be expected, picked holes in both proposals. In
the carriage of soup to the sick Sir John sees difficulty on account of
the scarcity of horses, which are, he says, diminishing fast. And he
adds, that several, if not all of the judges, who were then proceeding
on circuit, were obliged to take the same horses from Dublin throughout,
as they would have no chance of changing them as usual. Then with regard
to the decent burial of the dead, Sir John thought there were legal
difficulties in the way, and that legislation was necessary before it
could be done. He failed to produce any objection against the
appointment of the medical officers. In a fortnight after, a Treasury
Minute was issued to the effect that Relief Committees should be
required to employ proper persons to bury, with as much attention to the
feelings of the survivors as circumstances would admit, <a id="Page_407"></a>the dead bodies
which could not be buried by any other means. How urgently such an order
was called for appears from the fact, that at that time in the
neighbourhood of Skull, none but strangers, hired by the clergy, could
be found to take any part in a burial.<a href="#Footnote_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239" class="pginternal">[239]</a></p>
<p>The incumbent of Skull, the Key. Robert Traill Hall,<a href="#Footnote_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240" class="pginternal">[240]</a> a month after
Captain Caffin's letter was published, says, "the distress was nothing
in Captain Caffin's time compared with what it is now." On reading
Captain Caffin's letter, one would suppose, that destitution could not
reach a higher point than the one at which he saw it. That letter fixed
the attention of the Government upon Skull, and yet, strange result,
after a month of such attention, the Famine is intensified there,
instead of being alleviated.</p>
<p>Mr. Commissary Bishop had charge of the most famine-visited portion of
the Co. Cork (Skibbereen always excepted), including West Carbery,
Bantry and Bere. He seems to have been an active, intelligent officer,
and a kind-hearted man; yet his communications, somehow, must have
misled the Government, for Mr. Trevelyan starts at Captain Caffin's
letter, as if suddenly awakened from a dream. Its contents appeared to
be quite new, and almost incredible to him. No wonder, perhaps. On the
29th of January, a fortnight before the publication of Captain Caffin's
letter, Mr. Bishop writes to Mr. Trevelyan: "The floating depôt for
Skull arrived yesterday, and has commenced issues; <i>this removes all
anxiety for that quarter</i>." On the day before Captain Caffin's letter
was written, Mr. Bishop says: "At Skull, in both east and west division,
I found the distress, or rather the mortality had pretty well
increased." And this, notwithstanding the floating depôt. Yet in the
midst of the famine-slaughter described by Captain Caffin, Mr. Bishop is
still hopeful, for he says: "The Relief Committees at Skull and
<a id="Page_408"></a>Crookhaven exert themselves greatly to benefit the poor. There is an
ample supply of provisions at each place."<a href="#Footnote_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241" class="pginternal">[241]</a> How did they manage to
die of starvation at Skull?—one is tempted to ask. Yet they did, and at
Ballydehob too, the other town of the parish; for, three weeks after the
announcement of the "ample supply of provisions," the following news
reaches us from the latter place, on the most reliable authority. A
naval officer, Mr. Scarlet, who was with the "Mercury" and "Gipsey"
delivering provisions in the neighbourhood of Skull, on his return to
Cork, writes, on the 8th of March, to his admiral, Sir Hugh Pigot, in
these terms: "After discharging our cargoes in the boats to Ballydehob,
we went on shore, and on passing through the town we went into the ruins
of a house, and there were two women lying dead, and two, all but dead,
lying along with them. When we enquired how it was that they did not
bury them, a woman told us that they did not know, and that one of them
had been dead for five days. As we were coming down to the boat, we told
the boat's crew if they wanted to see a sight, to go up the street. When
they went, there were four men with hand-barrows there, and the men
belonging to the boats helped to carry the corpses to the burial ground,
where they dug holes, and put them in without coffins."</p>
<p>At this period of the Famine, things had come to such a pass, that
individual cases of death from starvation were seldom reported, and when
they were they failed to attract much attention, deaths by wholesale had
become so common. To be sure, when Dr. Crowley wrote from Skibbereen
that himself and Dr. Donovan had interred, in a kitchen garden, the
corpse of a person eleven days dead, the case, being somewhat peculiar,
had interest enough to be made public; but an ordinary death from hunger
would be deemed a very ordinary affair indeed. I will here give a
specimen <a id="Page_409"></a>or two, of the way in which the progress of the Famine was
chronicled at the close of 1846, and through the winter and spring of
1847. The correspondent of the <i>Kerry Examiner</i>, writing from Dingle
under date of February the 8th says: "The state of the people of this
locality is horrifying. Fever, famine and dysentery are daily
increasing, deaths from hunger daily occurring, averaging weekly
twenty—men, women and children thrown into the graves without a
coffin—dead bodies in all parts of the country, being several days dead
before discovered—no inquests to inquire how they came by their death,
as hunger has hardened the hearts of the people. Those who survive
cannot long remain so—the naked wife and children of the deceased,
staring them in the face—their bones penetrating through the skin—not
a morsel of flesh to be seen on their bodies—and not a morsel of food
can they procure to eat. From all parts of the country they crowd into
the town for relief, and not a pound of meal is to be had in the
wretched town for any price."</p>
<p>"This parish (Keantra, Dingle) contained, six months since, three
thousand souls; over five hundred of these have perished, and
three-fourths of them interred coffinless. They were carried to the
churchyard, some on lids and ladders, more in baskets—aye, and scores
of them thrown beside the nearest ditch, and there left to the mercy of
the dogs, which have nothing else to feed on. On the 12th instant I went
through the parish, to give a little assistance to some poor orphans and
widows. I entered a hut, and there were the poor father and his three
children dead beside him, and in such a state of decomposition that I
had to get baskets, and have their remains carried in them."<a href="#Footnote_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242" class="pginternal">[242]</a></p>
<p>A hearse piled with coffins—or rather rough, undressed boards slightly
nailed together—each containing a corpse, <a id="Page_410"></a>passed through the streets
of Cork, unaccompanied by a single human being, save the driver of the
vehicle. Three families from the country, consisting of fourteen
persons, took up their residence in a place called Peacock Lane, in the
same city. After one week the household stood thus: Seven dead, six in
fever, one still able to be up.</p>
<p>The apostle of temperance, the Rev. Theobald Mathew, gave the following
evidence before a Committee of the House of Lords on "Colonization from
Ireland":—</p>
<p><i>Question 2,359</i>. "You have spoken of the state of things [the Famine]
as leading to a very great influx of wretchedness and pauperism into the
City of Cork. Will you yourself describe what you have seen and known?"</p>
<p>"No tongue," he answers, "can describe—no understanding can
conceive—the misery and wretchedness that flowed into Cork from the
western parts of the county; the streets were impassable with crowds of
country persons. At the commencement they obtained lodgings, and the
sympathies of the citizens were awakened; but when fever began to spread
in Cork they became alarmed for themselves, and they were anxious at any
risk to get rid of those wretched creatures. The lodging-house keepers
always turned them out when they got sick. We had no additional fever
hospitals; the Workhouse was over full, and those poor creatures
perished miserably in the streets and alleys. Every morning a number
were found dead in the streets; they were thrown out by the poor
creatures in whose houses they lodged. Many of them perished in rooms
and cellars, without its being known, and without their receiving any
aid from those outside. It may appear as if the citizens of Cork and the
clergy of Cork had neglected their duty; but they did not. The calamity
was so great and so overwhelming, that it was impossible to prevent
those calamities. As one instance, I may mention that one Sunday morning
I brought Captain Forbes, who came over with the 'Jamestown,' United
States' frigate, and <a id="Page_411"></a>Mr. William Rathbone, and several other persons,
to show the state of the neighbourhood in which I resided, and to show
them the thousands whom we were feeding at the depôt, While we were
going round a person told me, 'There is a house that has been locked up
two or three days.' It was a cabin in a narrow alley. We went in, and we
saw seventeen persons lying on the floor, all with fever, and no one to
give them assistance. Captain Forbes was struck with horror; he never
thought there could be in any part of the world such misery. That was in
the south suburbs. A poor, wretched widow woman resided there; she let
it out for lodgings, and received those people as lodgers, who all got
the fever. We three gave what relief we could, and got them conveyed to
the hospitals; but they all died."</p>
<p><i>Question 2,365</i>. "Can you form any judgment what proportion of the
population, which is thus added at present, bears to the ordinary
population of the City of Cork?"</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. "Those poor creatures, the country poor, are now houseless and
without lodgings; no one will take them in; they sleep out at night. The
citizens of Cork have adopted what I consider a very unchristian and
inhuman line of conduct. They have determined to get rid of them. Under
the authority of an Act of Parliament, they take them up as sturdy
beggars and vagrants, and confine them at night in a market-place, and
the next morning send them out in a cart five miles from the town; and
there they are left, and a great part of them perish, for they have no
home to go to. When they fled from the country, their houses were thrown
down or consumed for fuel by the neighbours who remained, and those poor
creatures have no place to lay their heads."<a href="#Footnote_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243" class="pginternal">[243]</a></p>
<p><a id="Page_412"></a>It would be a useless and a harrowing task to continue such terrible
details, I therefore close this chapter with some account of Bantry,
that town having had the misfortune to be the rival of Skull,
Skibbereen, and Mayo during the Famine-slaughter.</p>
<p>The deaths at Bantry had become fearfully numerous before it attracted
any great share of public sympathy, or even, it would seem, of
Government attention. The <i>Southern Reporter</i> of January the 5th
publishes this curt announcement from that town: "Five inquests to-day.
Verdict—Death by starvation." The jury having given in its verdict, the
foreman, on their part, proceeded to say that they felt it to be their
duty to state, under the correction of the court, that it was their
opinion that if the Government of the country should persevere in its
determination of refusing to use the means available to it, for the
purpose of lowering the price of food, so as to place it within the
reach of the labouring poor, the result would be a sacrifice of human
life from starvation to a fearful extent, and endangerment of property
and the public peace. This remonstrance was committed to writing, and
signed E. O'Sullivan, foreman; Samuel Hutchins, J.P.; Richard White,
J.P.</p>
<p>One of the five cases was that of Catherine Sheehan, a child two years
old. She had been a strong healthy child, never having complained of any
sickness till she began to pine away for want of food. Her father was
employed on the public works, and earned ninepence a day, which was
barely enough to purchase food for himself, to enable him to continue at
work. This child had had no food for four days before her death, except
a small morsel of bread and seaweed. She died on the evening of
Christmas day.</p>
<p>The case of Richard Finn was another of the five. He went into a house
where they were making oatmeal gruel. He begged so hard for a little,
that the woman of the house <a id="Page_413"></a>took up some of it for him, when it was
about half boiled. The food disagreed with him, and he was able to take
only a small portion of it. He soon got into a fainting state, and was
lifted into a car by four men, in order to be carried to the Workhouse.
One of the priests, Rev. Mr. Barry, P.P., was sent for. He was at the
Relief Committee, but left immediately to attend Finn. In his
examination before the coroner, he said he found him in a dying state,
but quite in his senses. He would not delay hearing his confession till
he reached the Workhouse, but heard it in the car. Finn was then removed
to the House, and laid on a bed in his clothes, where he received the
sacrament of Extreme Unction. "I feared," said the Rev. Mr. Barry, "the
delay of stripping him." And the rev. gentleman was right, for he had
scarcely concluded his ministrations when Finn expired.</p>
<p>Every Catholic will understand how severely the physical and mental
energies of priests are taxed during times of fever, cholera, small pox,
and the like; but all such epidemics combined could scarcely cause them
such ceaseless work and sleepless anxiety as the Famine did, more
especially in its chief centres. To those who are not Catholics, I may
say that every priest feels bound, under the most solemn obligations, to
administer the last sacraments to every individual committed to his
care, who has come to the use of reason. What, then, must their lives
have been during the Famine? Not only had they to attend the dying, but
they were expected, and they felt it to be their duty, to be present at
Relief Committees, to wait on officials, write letters, and do
everything they thought could in any manner aid them in saving the lives
of the people. Their starving flocks looked to them for temporal as well
as spiritual help, and, in the Famine, they were continually in crowds
about their dwellings, looking for food and consolation. The priest was
often without food for himself, and had not the heart to meet his people
when he had nothing <a id="Page_414"></a>to give them. An instance of this occurred in a
severely visited parish of the West. The priest one day saw before his
door a crowd—hundreds, he thought—of his parishioners seeking relief.
He had become so prostrate and hopeless at their present sufferings and
future prospects, that, taking his Breviary, he left the house by a
private way, and bent his steps to a neighbouring wood. On reaching it,
he knelt down and began to recite his office aloud, to implore Almighty
God to have mercy on his people and himself. He did not expect to leave
that wood alive. After a time he heard a voice not far off; he became
alarmed, fearing his retreat had been discovered. Strange as the
coincidence seems, it is perfectly true; the voice he heard was that of
a neighbouring priest, a friend of his, who had taken the very same
course, and for the same reason. Gaining strength and consolation from
having met, and giving each other courage, they returned to their homes,
resolving to face the worst.</p>
<p>A physician, an excellent, kind-hearted man, who had been sent on duty
to Bantry in the later stages of the Famine, said one day to a priest
there—"Well, Father——, how are you getting on these times?" "Badly,"
was the reply, "for I often remain late in bed in the morning, not
knowing where to look for my breakfast when I get up."<a href="#Footnote_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244" class="pginternal">[244]</a></p>
<p>At this same time, there was a charitable lady in or near <a id="Page_415"></a>Bantry, who
had discovered that another of the priests was not unfrequently
dinnerless; so she insisted on being permitted to send him that
important meal, ready-cooked, at a certain hour every day, begging of
him to be at home, if possible, at the hour fixed. This arrangement went
on for a while to her great satisfaction, but news reached her one day
that Father —— seldom partook of her dinner. Such dreadful cases of
starvation came to his door, that he frequently gave the good lady's
dinner away. She determined that he must not sink and die; and to carry
out her view she hit upon an ingenious plan. She gave the servant, who
took the dinner to Father——, strict orders not to leave the house
until he had dined; the reason to be given to him for this was, that her
mistress wished her to bring back the things in which the dinner had
been carried to him. That priest, I am glad to say, is still among us,
and should these lines meet his eye, he will remember the circumstance,
and the honest and true authority on which it is related.</p>
<p>A short time after the five inquests above referred to were held, the
<i>Cork Examiner</i> published the following extract from a private letter:
"Each day brings with it its own horrors. The mind recoils from the
contemplation of the scenes we are compelled to witness every hour. Ten
inquests in Bantry—there should have been at least <i>two hundred
inquests</i>. Every day, every hour produces its own victims—holocausts
offered at the shrine of political economy. Famine and pestilence are
sweeping away hundreds, but they have now <i>no</i> terrors for the people.
Their only regret seems to be, that they are not relieved from their
sufferings by some process more speedy and less painful. <i>Since the
inquests were held here on Monday, there have been twenty-four deaths
from starvation</i>; and, if we can judge from appearances, before the
termination of another week the number will be incredible. As to holding
any more inquests, it is mere nonsense; <i>the number of deaths is beyond
counting</i>. <a id="Page_416"></a>Nineteen out of every twenty deaths that have occurred in
this parish, for the last two months, were caused by starvation. I have
known children in the remote districts of the parish, and in the
neighbourhood of the town, too, live, some of them for two, some three,
and some of them for <i>four days on water</i>! On the sea shore, or
convenient to it, the people are more fortunate, as they can get
<i>seaweed</i>, which, when boiled and mixed with a little Indian corn, or
wheaten meal, they eat, and thank Providence for providing them with
even that, to allay the cravings of hunger."</p>
<p>Although the writer of the above letter says, and with reason it would
seem, that the holding of any more inquests at Bantry was useless; the
very week after it was written, a batch of inquests were held there, one
of which bids fair to be, for a long time, famous, on account of the
verdict returned. There were forty deaths, but from some cause, perhaps
for want of time, there were only fifteen inquests. A respectable jury
having been sworn, the first of these was upon a man named John
Sullivan. One of the witnesses in the case said a messenger came and
announced to him that a man was lying on the old road in a bad state.
Witness proceeded to the place, but, in the first instance, alone;
finding the man still alive, he returned for help to remove him. He got
a servant boy and a cart; but on going again to where Sullivan was
lying, he found life was extinct. The jury having consulted, the foreman
announced their verdict in these terms: "From the multitude of deaths
which have taken place in the locality, and the number of inquests which
have already been held, without any good resulting, he thought, with his
fellow-jurors, that they ought to bring in a general verdict,
inculpating Lord John Russell, as the head of the Government. That
Minister had the power of keeping the people alive, and he would not do
so. Notwithstanding the fatal consequences which had attended his
policy, he had expressed his deter<a id="Page_417"></a>mination to persevere in the same
course, and therefore he (the foreman) thought that he was guilty of
this death and of the rest. He would bring in no other verdict but one
of <i>wilful murder</i> against Lord John Russell." The Rev. Mr. Barry
suggested that the verdict should simply record the immediate cause of
death—starvation; and the jury might append their opinion as to how far
it was attributable to the neglect of Lord John Russell in yielding to
the interests of a class of greedy monopolists. The foreman said he
wished it should be remembered that the opinion which he had expressed
with reference to the conduct of the Government was that of men upon
their oaths. A verdict was ultimately given of death from starvation,
with the addition mentioned.</p>
<p>The inquest was held in the Court-house, in presence of three
magistrates, assisted by the Catholic clergy of the town, and the
officers of the Constabulary.</p>
<p>Other verdicts of the same tendency, although not so decided in tone as
this one, were recorded in different parts of the country. At Lismore an
inquest was held on a man, also named Sullivan, and the jury found that
his death was caused by the neglect of the Government in not sending
food into the country <i>in due time</i>. In this town fourteen horses died
of starvation in one week.</p>
<p>Whilst Bantry was in the condition described above, Dr. Stephens was
sent by the Board of Health to examine the Workhouse there. He found it
simply dreadful. Here is an extract from his report, which duty compels
me, however unwillingly, to quote: "Language," he says, "would fail to
give an adequate idea of the state of the fever hospital. <i>Such an
appalling, awful, and heart-sickening condition</i> as it presented I never
witnessed, or could think possible to exist in a civilized or Christian
community. As I entered the house, the stench that proceeded from it was
most dreadful and noisome; but, oh! what scenes presented themselves to
my view as I proceeded through the wards <a id="Page_418"></a>and passages: patients lying
on straw, naked, and in their excrements, a light covering over them—in
two beds living beings beside the dead, in the same bed with them, and
dead since the night before." There was no medicine—no drink—no fire.
The wretched creatures, dying from thirst, were constantly crying
"Water, water," but there was no Christian hand to give them even a cup
of cold water for the love of God.</p>
<p>Towards the end of April, the Rev. Mr. Barry estimated the deaths from
famine, in Bantry alone, at four thousand.</p>
<p>Some time ago, speaking with a gentleman, a distinguished public man,
about the hinged coffin, he said: "At the time of the Famine I was a
boy, residing not far from Bantry. I have seen one of those hinged
coffins, which had borne more than three hundred corpses to the grave. I
have seen men go along the roads with it, to collect dead bodies as they
met them."</p>
<p>Good God! picking up human forms, made to Thy image and likeness, and
lately the tenements of immortal souls, as fishermen may sometimes be
seen on the seashore, gathering the <i>debris</i> of a wreck after a storm!</p>
<p>With such specimens of the Irish Famine before us, we cannot but feel
the justice, as well as the eloquence, of the following passage: "I do
not think it possible," writes Mr. A. Shafto Adair, "for an English
reader, however powerful his imagination, to conceive the state of
Ireland during the past winter, or its present condition. Famines and
plagues will suggest themselves, with their ghastly and repulsive
incidents—the dead mother—the dying infant—the feast of
cannibals—Athens—Jerusalem—Marseilles. But these awful facts stand
forth as dark spots in the illuminated chronicles of time; episodes, it
may be, of some magnificent epoch in a nation's history—tragedies acted
in remote times, or in distant regions—the actors, the inhabitants of
beleaguered cities, or the citizens of a narrow <a id="Page_419"></a>territory. But here the
tragedy is enacted with no narrower limits than the boundaries of a
kingdom, the victims—an entire people,—within our own days, at our own
thresholds."<a href="#Footnote_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245" class="pginternal">[245]</a></p>

<p><a href="#FNanchor_226_226" id="Footnote_226_226" class="pginternal">[226]</a> It is not to be inferred from this, that evictions were
rare in Ireland immediately preceding the Famine. A writer has taken the
trouble of recording in a pamphlet Irish evictions, from 1840 to the 3rd
of March, 1846; a period of about five years. Up to March, 1846,
evictions <i>arising from the Famine</i> had not really begun, although
preparations were being made for them; so that those recorded in the
pamphlet were carried out under no special pressure of circumstances
whatever. The writer premises that he regards his list as far from
complete, inasmuch as it was compiled chiefly from the public journals,
and every evicting landlord uses all his power and precaution to keep
his evictions as secret as possible; still, it was found on record, that
there were over 8,000 individuals evicted in Ireland during those five
years, many of the evictions being attended with much hardship and
suffering, such as the removal of sick and dying persons in order to
take possession. In one case a dead body was actually carried out. In
two instances, comprising the dispossession of 385 individuals, the
evictions took place avowedly for the purpose of bringing in Protestant
tenants; in a third, 1175 persons were evicted by a noble lord, and
although he did not give his reason, his name and his whole career
abundantly justify the conclusion that this vast clearance was effected
to make way for a Protestant colony.</p>

timber of a sliding or hinged coffin. One of these he kindly presented
to the author, which is now in his possession. It is two feet three
inches long, by one foot one inch across the arms. It bears the
following inscription:—

"During the frightful famine-plague, which devastated a large proportion
of Ireland in the years 1846-47, that monstrous and unchristian machine,
a "sliding coffin," was, from necessity, used in Bantry Union for the
conveyance of the victims to one common grave. The material of this
cross, the symbol of our Redemption, is a portion of one of the
machines, which enclosed the remains of several hundreds of our
countrymen, during their passage from the wretched huts or waysides,
where they died, to the pit into which their remains were
thrown.—T.W."</p>
