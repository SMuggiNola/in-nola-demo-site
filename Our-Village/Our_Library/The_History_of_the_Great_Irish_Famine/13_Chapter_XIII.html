<p>The expansion of the system of Public Works, under the Labour-rate Act,
was as unparalleled as it was unexpected by the Government. The number
of persons employed rose, in less than three months, from 20,000 to four
hundred thousand; the return for the week ending on the 5th of October
was just 20,000; for the week ending on the 26th of December, 398,000!
there being at the latter period at <a id="Page_421"></a>least one hundred and fifty
thousand on the books of the officers of the works, who either would not
or could not be employed; the famine-stricken were, meantime, hastening
to their shroudless and coffinless graves by the thousand. During its
progress the terrible scourge was checked more or less by the various
means made use of, but it was never stayed. The Government were not only
astonished—they were profoundly alarmed at the magnitude to which the
public works had grown. Almost the sole object of those works was <i>to
apply a labour test to destitution</i>; but the authorities now felt that
they must dismiss that pet theory of theirs and try to feed the people
in the most direct way possible.</p>
<p>At the opening of Parliament the Prime Minister brought forward, as we
have seen, a new Irish Relief Act, the 10th Vic., c. 7. It was called an
Act for the temporary relief of destitute persons in Ireland. It was
framed according to the views expressed by the Prime Minister in his
speech of January the 25th, and became law on the 26th of February.</p>
<p>The first clause acknowledged that the Labour-rate Act failed to meet
the exigency, for it recites that "by reason of the great increase of
destitution in Ireland, sufficient relief could not be given according
to the provisions of the Labour-rate Act;" the Lord Lieutenant was,
therefore, empowered to appoint Commissioners for the relief of
destitution in that country, with full authority to carry out all
arrangements under the Act. Its chief provisions were: That Relief
Committees should be formed by order of the Lord Lieutenant, and their
powers were to extend to the 1st of November, 1847, on which day they
were to cease. Those Committees were to consist of the Justices of the
district, the Poorlaw Guardians, and one of the Inspectors appointed by
the Relief Commissioners. A Finance Committee was to be selected from
the General Committee, but the Lord Lieutenant was empowered to add
others to it. <a id="Page_422"></a>A chief duty of Relief Committees was to make out lists
of persons requiring relief, but the Finance Committees had authority to
examine such lists, and correct them if necessary. The money required
for this new system of relief was to be levied and collected as a
poor-rate; and the guardians of any Union who refused to do this could
be dissolved by the Poorlaw Commissioners, who were also empowered to
appoint paid Guardians in their place. The Treasury, on being applied to
by the Relief Commissioners, was authorized to make advances to enable
them to grant loans in aid of rates, but no such grant or loan was to be
made after the 1st of October, 1847.</p>
<p>There is a clause in this Act which is not without its interest at the
present time. It is the thirteenth. It recites that "the Relief
Commissioners, with the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant, are empowered
to direct, whether the whole or any part of the sum mentioned ... shall
be borne by and charged exclusively against the Electoral Division, or
whether the whole or any part thereof shall be borne by and charged
against the whole Union; and the Guardians shall charge the whole Union,
and the several Electoral Divisions accordingly."</p>
<p>Here is Union-rating in 1847.</p>
<p>Immediate preparations were made to carry this Act into effect.
Commissioners were appointed; a General Order was issued by the Lord
Lieutenant, and in due time that most potential of documents, a Treasury
Minute, was published.<a href="#Footnote_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246" class="pginternal">[246]</a></p>
<p>In virtue of the powers conferred on him, his Excellency, in his General
Order, declared that besides the justices, Poorlaw Guardians and Relief
Inspector; archbishops and bishops of every denomination, the principal
officiating <a id="Page_423"></a>clergy of the three denominations, and the three highest
ratepayers of the district should be members of Relief Committees. Some
further regulations were made to meet such special difficulties as might
arise. In the next place his Excellency defined the duties of Government
Inspectors. They were: 1. To direct and stimulate the Committees within
their districts; 2. They were to exercise vigilance in order that relief
should be given only to persons really in need of it; 3. And they were
commanded to interfere as little as possible with Committees that were
performing their duties well, whilst, at the same time, it was laid down
as their duty to interfere with, and address Committees whose
proceedings were of an injurious kind.</p>
<p>As to Finance Committees, the Lord Lieutenant explained that they were
to be composed of the resident gentlemen, who had the greatest interest
in the welfare of the districts. The legislature intended, he said, that
they were to be the superintending controlling bodies over the
proceedings of the Committees of Electoral Divisions, inasmuch as it was
to them the country had to look for the carrying out of the provisions
of the Act, with the least injury to the great interests concerned.
There is no doubt that in this matter the Lord Lieutenant used the
powers vested in him with a good deal of freedom as to the appointment
of the Finance Committees. The clause of the Act referring to them (the
6th) runs thus: "And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, in every case in which it shall appear to him
expedient, to appoint in every Union in which this Act shall be in
force, a Finance Committee, which shall consist of the Inspector, to be
appointed as aforesaid by the Relief Commissioners for such Union, and
of such justices resident in the Union, or such other persons as the
Lord Lieutenant should think fit, not being less than two and not more
than four persons in addition to such Inspector."</p>
<p>The Treasury Minute repeats the numbers on the public <a id="Page_424"></a>works during the
month of February. They were, in the</p>

<p>being nearly a million of money for that month. Besides excluding the
expenditure of the Commissariat, this account did not, of course, take
in the very large sums disbursed by charitable bodies and by private
individuals.</p>
<p>The new Relief Act came into force on the 27th of February, and the
Government obtained, without any difficulty, the permission of
Parliament to borrow £8,000,000, to carry out its provisions. As this
Act was to supersede the Public Works, it was decreed by the Treasury
Minute that on Saturday the 20th of March the labourers on those works
should be reduced by not less than twenty per cent. The remainder were
to be dismissed by successive reductions, at such times and in such
proportions as would be determined by the Board. The order in which
dismissals wore to be carried out was, that persons holding ten acres of
land and upwards, were to be discharged on the 20th of March, <i>even if
they should exceed the twenty per cent.</i>; if they fell below it, the
persons holding the next largest quantity of land should be discharged
in order that the full twenty per cent. should be dismissed. In
districts where rations of soup could be supplied by the Relief
Committees, the Relief Works were to be entirely suspended.</p>
<p>It was added in the Minute, that as the Commissioners of Public Works
were of opinion that, in existing circum<a id="Page_425"></a>stances, the mode of employing
persons by task work did not answer the expectations that were formed of
it, there should be a recurrence to daily pay, at such rates as might be
fixed with the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
<p>As soon as the Relief Commissioners entered upon their duties, they drew
up a code of rules for the information and guidance of Relief
Committees.</p>
<p>The following are the principal:</p>
<p>1. Relief Committees to be under the regulating control of a Finance
Committee for each Union.</p>
<p>2. As to funds:—local or other subscriptions, with donations from
Government and moneys in hand of Poorlaw Guardians, to be regarded as
appropriated rates on electoral divisions, where needed.</p>
<p>3. The funds in hands of existing Relief Committees were to be generally
available for Committees under the new Act.</p>
<p>4. Relief to be given exclusively in food; gratuitously to the
absolutely desolate; by reasonable prices to such, as were in
employment, or had the means of purchasing.</p>
<p>5. There was to be a Government Inspector of every Union, who was to be
an <i>ex-officio</i> member of every Committee under the Act in the Union.</p>
<p>9. Persons requiring relief were to be classed under <i>four</i> heads,
namely: (1) Those who were destitute, helpless or impotent; (2)
Destitute able-bodied persons not holding land; (3) Destitute
able-bodied persons who were holders of small portions of land; (4) The
able-bodied employed at wages insufficient for their support, when the
price of food was very high.</p>
<p>10. The first three classes to get gratuitous relief, but the fourth to
be relieved by the sale of food of a cheap description: and it was
specially laid down that there were to be "no gratuitous supplies of
food to them." "This," say the Instructions, "is to be a fixed rule."
Yet it was afterwards modified with regard to class 4: the <a id="Page_426"></a>clause
saying "they were to be relieved by the sale of food of a cheap
description" did not, it would seem, mean that such food was to be sold
under its value. This was represented as a hardship, and on the 11th of
May the Relief Commissioners ruled, that with regard to the price of
food to class 4, "any food cooked in a boiler might be sold under first
cost."</p>
<p>12. Persons receiving wages, or refusing hire, to be excluded from
gratuitous relief.</p>
<p>15. To entitle holders of land to gratuitous relief, it should be
absolutely required of them to proceed with the cultivation of their
land.</p>
<p>The relief lists were to be revised every fortnight; the food best
suited to each district, and the most easily obtained <i>there</i>, to be at
once taken into consideration.</p>
<p>As to rations, it was considered that the most nourishing and economical
food was soup made after some of the approved receipts, with a portion
of bread, meal, or biscuit.</p>
<p>The 26th rule fixed the quantity and quality of a ration.</p>
<p>It was to consist of</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div>1½ lbs. of bread; or</div>
<div>1 lb. of biscuit; or</div>
<div>1 lb. of meal or flour of any grain; or</div>
<div>1 quart of soup thickened with a portion of
meal, according to the known receipts,
and one quarter ration of bread, biscuit or
meal, in addition.</div></div>
</div>
<p>Persons above nine years of age to have one full ration; those under
that age half a ration.</p>
<p>These rules were promulgated from the Relief Commission Office, in
Dublin Castle, on the 8th of March.</p>
<p>A difficulty having arisen as to what could be strictly considered
"soup," the following definition of it was issued by the Relief
Commissioners to the Inspecting officers of each Union.</p>
<p>"<a id="Page_427"></a>Sir, As the term 'Soup' in the Instructions seems to have created an
impression with many parties, that only the liquid ordinarily so called
is meant, and that meat must necessarily form an ingredient, the Relief
Commissioners beg that the general term 'soup,' in their Instructions,
may be understood to include any food cooked in a boiler, and
distributed in a liquid state, thick or thin, and whether composed of
meat, fish, vegetables, grain or meal."</p>
<p>The Commissioners published their first report on the 10th of March,
eleven days after the Relief Act came into force; an exceedingly short
time for them in which to have done anything worth reporting; but this
is explained by the fact, that they and their officers had been set to
work a considerable time before the Relief Act had become law; the
Government assuming that it would meet with no real opposition in its
passage through Parliament.</p>
<p>From this Report we learn that there were, at the time, 2049 electoral
divisions in Ireland; and from a later one, that Blackrock, near Dublin,
was the smallest electoral division, consisting only of 257 acres; that
the largest was Belmullet, in the County of Mayo, which contained
145,598 acres. The extremes in the valuation of electoral divisions
were,—Mullaghderg, in Glenties Union, £331 10s. 0d.; South Dublin,
£402,516 3s. 4d. So that a shilling rate levied off Mullaghderg would
produce just £16 12s. 6d., which in all probability would not pay for
the time necessary to collect it.<a href="#Footnote_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247" class="pginternal">[247]</a></p>
<p>The Commissioners report, that two conditions laid down by them had
called forth several remonstrances, namely, (1) The prohibition of
administering relief under the Act <i>in aid of wages</i>; and (2) The
restriction to the sale of food under cost price, with the exception of
soup.</p>
<p>The quantity of stationery necessary for the carrying out <a id="Page_428"></a>of the Relief
Act is certainly worth noting. In the mere preparation for their work,
the Commissioners had delivered to them upwards of 10,000 books, 80,000
sheets, and 3,000,000 of card tickets; the gross weight of all not being
less than fourteen tons! Two Inspectors, Major Parker and Captain Drury,
having caught fever at Skibbereen and Kinsale respectively, fell victims
to it.</p>
<p>Lest they should be suspected of not being true believers in Political
Economy, the Commissioners thus conclude their first report: "Your
Lordships are aware that the relief that we are now administering is not
only of a temporary character, but necessarily of a nature contrary to
all sound principles of policy."</p>
<p>The determination of the authorities to supply, as far as possible, the
starving people with cooked food, especially soup, made the question of
preparing it for millions one of vast importance. To produce the
greatest quantity of cooked food in a palatable form, at the minimum of
cost, and with the maximum of nutrition, might save the country half a
million of money, and many thousands of lives besides. With this object
the Government fixed upon Monsieur Soyer of the Reform Club, and
appointed him Head Cook to the people of Ireland. His elevation to this
unique office was announced with considerable flourish. "We learn," says
one of the London journals, "that the Government have resolved forthwith
to despatch M. Soyer, the <i>chef de cuisine</i> of the Reform Club, to
Ireland, with ample instructions to provide his soups for the starving
millions of Irish people." And this journal further informs us that
artizans were busy day and night constructing kitchens, apparatus, etc.,
with which M. Soyer was to start for Dublin, "direct to the Lord
Lieutenant." His plans had been examined and approved of. The soup had
been served to several of the best judges "of the noble art of
gastronomy in the Reform Club, not as soup for the poor, but as soup
furnished for the day, in the <i>carte</i>." It was <a id="Page_429"></a>declared excellent. He
undertook to supply the whole poor of Ireland, at one meal for each
person each day. This meal with a biscuit, he assured the Executive,
would be more than sufficient to sustain the strength of a strong and
healthy man. One hundred gallons of the soup was to be produced for £1.
And M. Soyer had satisfied the Government, that he would furnish enough
and to spare of most nourishing food "for the poor of these realms;" and
it was confidently anticipated that there would be no more deaths from
starvation in Ireland.<a href="#Footnote_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248" class="pginternal">[248]</a></p>
<p>M. Soyer arrived in Dublin on the 1st of March, bringing with him his
model kitchen and apparatus, and a building to receive them was erected
on the ground in front of the Royal Barracks, and not far from the
principal entrance to the Phoenix Park. Before leaving London he had
published some of the receipts according to which he intended to make
various kinds of soups for the starving Irish. Objections were raised in
the columns of the <i>Times</i> against the small quantity of meat he used in
making some of those soups. "A brother <i>artiste</i>," as M. Soyer calls
him, maintained that a quarter of a pound of meat, allowed in making two
gallons of his soup No. 1, was not at all enough. M. Soyer rather
jauntily replies that he had made two gallons of excellent soup without
any meat, and that he had, at the moment, three soups "on taste," two
with meat and one without, and he defied the "scientific palate" of his
brother <i>artiste</i> "to tell which was which." "The meat," says M. Soyer,
"I consider of no more value than the other ingredients, but to give a
flavour by properly blending the gelatine and the osmazome, for," he
adds with complacent self-reliance, "in compounding the richest soup,
the balance of it is the great art."</p>
<p><a id="Page_430"></a>His brother <i>artiste</i>, M. Jaquet, of Johnson's tavern, Clare Court,
rejoins that he never questioned M. Soyer's ability to make a palatable
and pleasing soup with little or no meat, but that he himself had not
acquired the valuable art of making nutritious and useful soup without
meat, and that he would not like to make the experiment of doing so,
"for the use of the destitute poor." He expressed the hope that receipt
No. 1 might be analyzed, and if it had all things necessary for
nourishment, he, of course, was silenced.</p>
<p>M. Jaquet had his wish. Scientific people took up M. Soyer's receipts,
and dealt with them,—correctly and justly, no doubt, but in a manner
that must have been anything but agreeable to the great <i>artiste</i> of the
Reform Club, who seems to have had very exalted ideas of the importance
of the mission on which he was sent to Ireland.</p>
<p>Thus wrote the <i>Lancet</i> on the subject: "The mass of the poor population
of Ireland is in a state of starvation. Gaunt famine, with raging fever
at her heels, are marching through the length and breadth of the sister
island, and they threaten to extend their fury to this Country. The
British public, under the form of clubs, committees, and relief
associations, are actively engaged in sending food to the famine
districts. All this is done without boasting or ostentation. But
parliament and the executive, in the midst of the best intentions, seems
to be agitated by a spasmodic feeling of benevolence; at one time
adopting public works, at another preaching a poorlaw—now considering
the propriety of granting sixteen millions for railways, and then
descending to M. Soyer, the chief cook of the Reform Club, with his
ubiquitous kitchens and soups, at some three farthings the quart, which
is to feed all hungry Ireland.</p>
<p>"As this soup quackery (for it is no less) seems to be taken by the rich
as a salve for their consciences, and with a belief that famine and
fever may be kept at bay by M. Soyer and his kettles, it is right to
look at the constitution <a id="Page_431"></a>of this soup of pretence, and the estimate
formed of it by the talented but eccentric self-deceived originator.</p>
<p>"M. Soyer proposes to make soup of the following proportions:—Leg of
beef, four ounces; dripping fat, two ounces; flour, eight ounces; brown
sugar, half an ounce; water, <i>two gallons</i>.</p>
<p>"These items are exclusive of the onions, a few turnip parings,
celery-tops, and a little salt, which can hardly be considered under the
head of food. The above proportions give less than three ounces of solid
nutriment to each quart of soup a la Soyer. Of this its inventor is
reported to have said to the Government 'that a bellyful once a day,
with a biscuit, (we quote from the <i>Observer</i>,) will be more than
sufficient to maintain the strength of a strong healthy man.'</p>
<p>"To bring this to the test. Organic chemistry proves to us that the
excretæ from the body of a healthy subject by the eliminatory organs
must at least amount to twelve or fourteen ounces; and organic chemistry
will not, we fear, bend to the most inspired receipts of the most
miraculous cookery book, to supply the number of ounces without which
the organic chemistry of the human body will no more go on than will the
steam-engine without fuel. M. Soyer, supposing each meal of his soup for
the poor to amount to a quart, supplies less than three ounces, or less
than a quarter the required amount, and of that only one solitary half
ounce of animal aliment, diluted, or rather dissolved in a bellyful of
water. Bulk of water, the gastronomic may depend, will not make up for
the deficiency of solid convertible aliment. No culinary digesting, or
stewing, or boiling, can convert four ounces into twelve, unless,
indeed, the laws of animal physiology can be unwritten, and some magical
power be made to reside in the cap and apron of the cook for
substituting fluids in the place of solids, and <i>aqua pura</i> in place of
solids in the animal economy.</p>
<p>"It seems necessary to bring forward these facts, as <a id="Page_432"></a>M. Soyer's soup
has inspired the public mind with much satisfaction—a satisfaction
which, we venture to say, will never reach the public stomach.</p>
<p>"Marquises and lords and ladies may taste the meagre liquid, and
pronounce it agreeable to their gustative inclinations; but something
more than an agreeable titilation of the palate is required to keep up
that manufactory of blood, bone, and muscle which constitutes the
'strong healthy man.'"</p>
<p>During M. Soyer's visit to Ireland, a Dublin chemist read, before the
Royal Dublin Society, a paper upon the nutritive and pecuniary value of
various kinds of cooked food. He had previously put himself in
communication with M. Soyer, who showed him over his model kitchen, and
allowed him to analyze his soups. The result of this analysis was
remarkable, for he found that M. Soyer's dearest soup was the least
nutritive, whilst his cheapest soup was the most so: a proportion which
held through all the soups analyzed; their nutritive qualities being in
an inverse ratio to their prices. In his calculation the chemist takes a
child of four stones weight, as the average of persons who required food
relief, and he found that—</p>
<blockquote><div><p>160 gallons of Soyer's soup No. 2 would give sufficient nutriment
     to 213 such children for one day. Its price was 2-3/4d. the gallon.</p>
<p>     160 gallons of Soyer's soup No. 4 would give sufficient nutriment
     to 420 such children for one day. Its price was 2-1/4d. the gallon.</p>
<p>     160 gallons of his soup No. 5 would give sufficient nutriment to
     385 such children for one day. Its price was 2-1/2d. the gallon.</p>
<p>     160 gallons of his soup No. 6 (a fish soup) would give sufficient
     nutriment to 700 such children for one day. Its price was only
     1-3/4d. the gallon.<a href="#Footnote_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249" class="pginternal">[249]</a></p></div></blockquote>
<p><a id="Page_433"></a>So that the famous cook of the Reform Club did not know the comparative
nutritive qualities of his own soups.</p>
<p>But a still greater came on the scene in the person of Sir Henry Marsh,
the Queen's physician, and long at the head of his profession in this
country. He published a pamphlet of some ten pages, not for the purpose
of finding fault with M. Soyer or his soups, but evidently to set the
public right on the question of food, as they seemed to have taken up
the idea that there resided some hidden power in the cook's receipt,
distinct from the ingredients he used. Sir Henry thus deals with soup
food:—</p>
<p>"A soft semi-liquid diet will maintain the life and health of children,
and in times of scarcity will be sufficient for those adults whose
occupations are sedentary, and is best suited to those who are reduced
by and recovering from a wasting disease. Such persons stand in no need
of the more abundant and more substantial nutriment which is essential
to those who are daily engaged in occupations exacting much muscular
labour. In the preparation and distribution of food, this I believe to
be an important point, and one which should be held steadily in view.
For the labourer the food must be in part solid, requiring mastication
and insalivation, and not rapid of digestion. Food, however nutritious,
which is too quickly digested, is soon followed by a sense of hunger and
emptiness, and consequent sinking and debility. Food of this description
is unsuited to the labourer. It will not maintain strength, nor will it
maintain health, and, if long persevered in, it will be followed by some
one or other of the prevailing diseases which result immediately from
deficient, imperfect, and impoverished blood."</p>
<p>Again:—</p>
<p>"Our attention must not be too exclusively directed to soups and other
semi-liquid articles of food. These pass away too rapidly from the
stomach, are swallowed too hastily, and violate a natural law in
superseding the <a id="Page_434"></a>necessity of mastication, and a proper admixture with
the salivary secretion. Restricted to such food the carnivora cannot
maintain life; nor can man, being half carnivorous, if laboriously
employed, long preserve health and strength on food of such
character.... Food, to be at once sustaining to the labourer, and
preventive of disease, must have bulk—must possess solidity—must not
be rapidly digestible, and must contain, in varied proportions, all the
staminal ingredients of nutriment."</p>
<p>Sir Henry Marsh, said one of the morning journals, did not attack M.
Soyer, but he demolished the soup kitchen as effectively as if he did.</p>
<p>As soon as M. Soyer's model soup depôt was completed, he resolved to
open it for public inspection with a good deal of ceremony. On the 5th
of April, therefore, the opening day, the space in front of the Royal
Barracks presented a very animated scene; flags floated gaily in the
breeze; the rich dresses of ladies of birth and fashion contrasted
pleasingly with the costly and superb military uniforms among which they
moved; and M. Soyer was all politeness in explaining to his
distinguished visitors the arrangements and perfections of his soup
kitchen. In a famine-stricken land, the good taste of this exhibition
was doubtful enough: at any rate it was criticised with no sparing hand.</p>
<p>When I got a card of invitation, writes one, I thought I was to see M.
Soyer's peculiar appliances for making soup for the poor; but no—it was
a "gala day:" drums beating, flags flying. Then the writer grows
political, and says bitterly, that he "envied not the Union flag the
position it occupied as it flaunted in triumph from the chimney top of
the soup kitchen; it was its natural and most meet position; the rule of
which it is the emblem has brought our country to require soup
kitchens,—and no more fitting ornament could adorn their tops." All the
parade he could, he says, have borne, but what he considered
indefensible was the <a id="Page_435"></a>exhibition of some hundreds of Irish beggars "to
demonstrate what ravening hunger will make the image of God submit
to."<a href="#Footnote_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250" class="pginternal">[250]</a> "His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant was there," wrote the
<i>Evening Packet</i> (a Conservative journal); "the ladies Ponsonby and many
other fair and delicate creatures assembled; there were earls and
countesses, and lords and generals, and colonels and commissioners, and
clergymen and doctors; for, reader, it was a <i>gala day</i>,—a <i>grand
gala</i>." The provincial press dealt with the proceedings in the same
spirit.</p>
<p>Like many other great men, M. Soyer, in a short time, found that Ireland
was his "difficulty;" so he resolved, somewhat suddenly, it would
appear, to return to the more congenial atmosphere of the Reform Club.
His resolution was thus announced in one of the Dublin morning journals:
"SOYER'S MODEL KITCHEN.—By the special desire of several charitable
ladies, who have visited and paid particular attention to the working of
the model kitchen, it will be opened again on Saturday next, from two to
six, on which day those ladies, under the direction of Mrs. L——, will
attend and serve the poor. The admission for the view on that day will
be five shillings each, to be distributed by the Lord Mayor in charity;
after which the kitchen will be closed, M. Soyer being obliged to leave
for the Reform Club, London." This smacked very much of a "positively
last appearance." Referring to it, a Dublin journal exclaims—"Five
shillings each to see paupers feed! Five shillings each to watch the
burning blush of shame chasing pallidness from poverty's wan cheek! Five
shillings each! When the animals in the Zoological Gardens can be
inspected at feeding time for <i>sixpence</i>!"<a href="#Footnote_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251" class="pginternal">[251]</a></p>
<p>A few gentlemen gave M. Soyer a dinner and a snuff box before he left,
and so his Irish mission was brought to a close; but his name was not
forgotten, for <i>Sawyer's soup</i> <a id="Page_436"></a>was long a standing joke with a certain
class of the Dublin people. Had the word come into popular use at the
time, there is little doubt that M. Soyer's undertaking to feed the
starving Irish would have been called a <i>fiasco</i>.<a href="#Footnote_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252" class="pginternal">[252]</a></p>
<p>Philanthropists of a stamp different from M. Soyer brought forward
schemes for the good of Ireland at this time. They related chiefly to
the reclamation of her waste lands. At the opening of Parliament in
1847, Lord John Russell, as we have seen, proposed to introduce a Bill
on this subject, one million being the first grant to be made for the
purpose. The plan on which the reclamation was to be carried out is
given in the resumè of Lord John's speech at the opening of the session.
It was the very best of the Premier's measures for the permanent
improvement of Ireland; but, according to Mr. D'Israeli, it was faintly
proposed, and finally abandoned in deference to the expressed opinion of
Sir Robert Peel, who, at the time, governed from the Opposition benches.</p>
<p>This question of the reclamation of our waste lands had been often
before Parliament and the public previous to 1847. The committee
relating to the poor of Ireland in the year <a id="Page_437"></a>1830 refer in their report
to no less than twelve preceding sessions in which the importance of
reclaiming the Irish wastes was strongly recommended, but the
publication of the "Industrial Resources of Ireland," by Dr. (now Sir
Robert) Kane, a short time before the Famine, directed public attention
anew to the subject.</p>
<p>The area of Ireland is 20,808,271 statute acres. Of these it is commonly
admitted that 18,600,000, or thereabouts, are susceptible of
cultivation. In 1845, somewhat over 13,000,000 of acres were in
cultivation, whilst nearly 5,000,000, which could be brought under
culture, lay barren. Referring to the estimate of those writers who held
that Ireland contained 4,600,000 acres of waste, which could be made
arable, Dr. Kane said he did not <a id="Page_438"></a>think the estimate too high; and this
opinion was quoted approvingly by Lord John Russell.<a href="#Footnote_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253" class="pginternal">[253]</a></p>
<p>But the question might still remain,—could those four and a-half
millions of acres he profitably cultivated? Would their cultivation give
remunerative interest on the capital expended? That is the purely
commercial view of the matter; but there is another which should not be
overlooked: Would it not be wise policy to increase the resources of a
country,—to increase its area of cultivation,—to extend the means of
employing and feeding its population, even though the work did not
actually make a very remunerative commercial return? English capital has
gone to make canals and railroads and harbours, and open mines for the
antipodes, often with little or no return; not unfrequently with total
loss; surely as much risk ought to be taken for home improvements, in
which patriotism should come to the aid of commercial enterprise. The
Chinese have, after their own fashion, devoted themselves to this kind
of improvement for centuries; so have the enlightened Dutch, the most
recent example of which is that noble engineering achievement, the
draining of the lake of Haarlem; and although the sale of the drained
land did not recoup the Government for the outlay, yet they felt the
work was a great national benefit, inasmuch as it added forty-three
thousand acres to the arable soil of Holland. So pleased indeed are they
with the result, that they have at present under consideration another
undertaking of the same kind, and of far greater extent, namely, the
draining of the Zuider Zee.</p>
<p><a id="Page_439"></a>It would seem, then, to be a question well worthy the consideration of
statesmen, whether or not, in the reclamation of wastes, it would be the
true and enlightened policy to act upon the commercial idea alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Fagan, a commercial man of sound practical ability, who sat in the
House of Commons for the County Wexford, put forward, in the famine
period, a scheme for the reclamation of the waste lands.<a href="#Footnote_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254" class="pginternal">[254]</a> It was
mainly based upon the principle, that the men whose labour reclaimed
those lands should have a beneficial interest in them. The wealth—the
capital of the poor man, he said, lie in the health and strength with
which God has endowed him, and if he be denied the means of employing
this capital profitably, what matters it to him that the harvest is
bountiful—that the corn stores are full? Mr. Fagan discusses several
plans according to which Irish waste lands might be reclaimed. 1.
Individual exertion. This, in his opinion, would not answer, because it
would be too slow, too isolated, to do the work in a broad,
comprehensive manner, and within a reasonable time. 2. The next plan
which he passes in review is what he terms joint-stock enterprise. This
he also rejects, as being expensive in management, and therefore
unremunerative. 3. Reclamation by the Government, so commonly advocated,
he also rejects, because he did not think such an undertaking within the
legitimate sphere of the Government, and that it would be inconsistent
with sound policy.</p>
<p>Having set aside these three modes of reclamation, he puts forward his
own.</p>
<p>1. He was of opinion that the principle of <i>individual</i> industry should
be applied to the reclamation of the waste lands, and that a reasonable
share of the fruits of the <a id="Page_440"></a>industry of the reclaimer should be secured
to him. Where enlightened proprietors have done this, their wastes, he
says, became fertile, and agrarian outrages were unknown. Give, in a
word, the Irish peasant the same interest in reclaiming the waste at
home, that he gets in reclaiming the waste abroad, and the same
beneficial results will follow.</p>
<p>2. For the right working of this principle, the waste lands should be
resumed by the State. This he regarded as an indispensable preliminary.
Pay the proprietors fully for them, let the ground be valued as it is
valued for railways; paid for at its present, not its prospective value,
and let it be vested in Commissioners. Lots of convenient size should be
made, and sold, when reclaimed; but at no higher price than twenty-four
years' purchase. The State should also empower the Commissioner to sell
waste, in lots of not less than ten acres; ten acres to be the minimum
of reclaimed lots also. Existing proprietors should have the option of
reclaiming or selling; but in the former case security should be given
that the work would be immediately proceeded with.</p>
<p>Mr. Fagan would ask no pecuniary aid from the Government to carry out
his plan; he would meet the expenses of it by an agency tax, that is, a
tax upon house and land agencies, and upon all agencies. In saying this
he must have meant, that he would not ask money out of the Consolidated
Fund; for he could not but have seen that in carrying it out by a tax of
any kind, he would be doing so by the aid of the Government. The effect
of Mr. Fagan's plan would have been, to create, to a certain extent, a
peasant proprietary.</p>
<p>Mr. Poulett Scrope, then representing the borough of Stroud in
Parliament, took much interest in Irish questions, more especially
during the Famine; at which time he, in a series of letters addressed to
Lord John Russell, put forward his views on the legislation which he
considered necessary under the existing circumstances of this country.
<a id="Page_441"></a>Three Bills in his opinion, should have been at once proceeded with in
Parliament; one to facilitate the sale of encumbered estates; one to
improve the relations between landlord and tenant; and the third for
commencing without delay the reclamation of the waste lands. This last
he considered as of the most pressing urgency. Strange enough, that
since Mr. Scrope wrote, laws have been passed on the two former
subjects, whilst the one considered by him the most necessary, still
remains unlegislated on. His great object was, he said, to create
employment, and to create it in the production of food, if possible.
Surely, says Mr. Scrope, if this can be created for the people at home,
it is much better, for a thousand reasons, than to attempt to find it
for them in America. "I cannot refrain," he writes, "from expressing
astonishment at the degree to which the almost inexhaustible resources
offered by the waste lands of Ireland for the production of employment
of the wretched and unwillingly idle labourers of that country, have
been overlooked and neglected, no less by statesmen than individual
proprietors."<a href="#Footnote_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255" class="pginternal">[255]</a></p>
<p>From whatever cause, Irish landowners did not, to any considerable
extent, take up, in earnest, the question of the reclamation of waste
lands. Roused by the pressure of the times and the impending poor-rate,
the majority of them looked, says Mr. Scrope, "for salvation" to other
means—to the eviction of their numerous tenantry—the clearing of their
estates from the seemingly superfluous population by emigration or
ejectment. "Yet," he continues, "nothing can be more true or more
capable of demonstration than the assertion that there is no real
redundancy of population in Ireland. Nay, that even in the most
distressed and apparently overcrowded districts, a wise and prudent
management of their natural resources might find profitable employment
for all, to the great advantage of the <a id="Page_442"></a>proprietors themselves, and the
still greater benefit of the people and the public, which is so deeply
interested in the result."<a href="#Footnote_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256" class="pginternal">[256]</a></p>
<p>The readers of these pages cannot forget that Mayo suffered as much as,
if not more than, any other county, during the Famine; yet here was the
state of its surface at the time of that dreadful visitation: entire
area of the County Mayo, 1,300,000 acres; of these only 500,000 acres
were under cultivation, 800,000 acres being unreclaimed; of which
800,000 acres, Griffith says, nearly 500,000 could be reclaimed with
profit;—that is, just half the county was cultivated. The Dean of
Killala gave the following evidence about the same county before the
Devon Commission: <i>Quest. 73</i>. "Is there sufficient employment for the
people in the cultivation of the arable land?" <i>Answ.</i> "No; it does not
employ them half the year." <i>Quest. 74</i>. "But there would be employment
for them in reclaiming the waste?" <i>Answ.</i> "Yes; more than ample, if
there was encouragement given. Where I reside there are many thousands
of acres waste, because it would not be let at a moderate rent." <i>Quest.
75</i>. "Is the land with you termed waste, capable of being made
productive?" <i>Answ.</i> "Yes; every acre of it."</p>
<p>On this same question of the reclamation of Irish waste lands and
redundant population, Commissary-General Hewetson, one of the principal
assistants of Sir Randal Routh, writes, in the height of the Famine:
"The transition from potatoes to grain requires tillage in the
proportion of <i>three</i> to <i>one</i>. It is useless, then, to talk of
emigration, <i>when so much extra labour</i> is indispensable to supply the
extra food. Let that labour be first applied, and it will be seen
whether there is any surplus population. <i>If the waste lands are taken
into cultivation</i>, and industrious habits established, it is very
doubtful whether there will be any surplus population, <i>or even</i> whether
it would be equal to the demand." "<a id="Page_443"></a>Providence," he adds, "has given
everything needful, and nothing is wanting but industry to apply it."
"Yes!" to use the words of Mr. Scrope, "there are two things more
wanted—namely, that Irish industry should have leave to apply itself to
the improvement of the Irish soil, and be assured of reaping the
undivided fruits of such application."<a href="#Footnote_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257" class="pginternal">[257]</a></p>
<p>From causes which can be only guessed at, there seems to have been
always a passive but most influential opposition to the reclamation of
the waste lands of Ireland. Its opponents never met the question in the
field of logical argument, yet, somehow, they had power enough to
prevent its being carried into effect. When Lord John Russell proposed
the million grant to begin the work, Sir Robert Peel said he thought
some more useful employment could be found for that sum, but he did not
even hint at what it was. A writer, who published in 1847 a work on
Ireland "Historical and Statistical," thus deals with the reclamation
question: "The Irish waste lands being of considerable extent have long
attracted the notice of speculators and improvers. They are about to
receive the attention of her Majesty's Government, and a sum of one
million is promised to the Irish landlords as an aid towards their
reclamation. But there is much room to doubt the policy of such a
proceeding at any time, and especially at the present time."<a href="#Footnote_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258" class="pginternal">[258]</a> Here
is a pretty decided opinion against reclamation, but there is no reason
whatever vouchsafed for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand those who were favourable to the reclamation of our
waste lands were rich in facts and arguments. In the Parliamentary
Session of 1835, a Committee of the House of Commons on public works
reported that "no experiment was necessary to persuade any scientific
<a id="Page_444"></a>man of the possibility of carrying into effect the reclamation of
bogs." Nor is this strongly expressed opinion to be wondered at,
founded, as it was, upon such evidence as the following:—</p>
<p>Mr. Griffith deposed that—</p>
<p>"The mountain bog of the south of Ireland—the moory bog—varies in
depth from nine inches to three feet, below which there is a clayey or
sandy subsoil. On the average, about £4 per statute acre is required to
bring it from a state of nature to one of cultivation, and then it will
fetch a rent of from 5s. to 10s. per English acre."</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p>"£1 4s. an acre is the highest estimate for the draining of this land in
covered drains; the remainder of the expense consists in the trenching
up the surface, turning up the subsoil, and mixing it with the bog; no
manure is wanted, a portion of the bog being burned for that purpose."</p>
<p>With regard to deep bogs, his testimony was as follows:</p>
<p>"The expense of reclaiming deep bogs per acre may be estimated
thus:—Drainage of an English acre, in the most perfect way, about £1
4s., which is about 40s. the Irish acre; that includes the under drain:
the levelling and digging comes to about £1 10s.; and afterwards the
claying comes to about £6 12s. per statute acre."</p>
<p>Finally, he said:</p>
<p>"The reclamation of mountain land is very profitable, and easily
effected; but the reclamation of deep bog land is attended with a much
greater expense, and requires both care and judgment. But both are
certainly reclaimable, and would give a successful return when
judiciously treated."</p>
<p>Mr. Featherstone, a practical and successful farmer, told the Committee
that he had reclaimed the worst sort of bog land for £13 an acre, and
some cushbog land for, £6 an acre: the former, when reclaimed, was worth
£1 an acre, and the latter £2 an acre. "It took me," he said, "£13 an
acre to reclaim the first red bog I tried my hand <a id="Page_445"></a>on: and it would take
to reclaim, on the average, the red bog of Ireland, £10 an acre."</p>
<p>The soundness of the views put forward by Sir Richard Griffith and Mr.
Featherstone is proved by the reclamation of similar wastes in England.
With regard to Chat-moss, on the Liverpool and Manchester railway, Mr.
Baines writes from Barton Grange, in Lancashire, which he calls "a house
standing in the midst of a tract of 2,000 acres of peat moss, within a
few years past as wet and barren as any morass in Ireland, but now
covered with luxuriant crops." He averages the sum expended in
reclaiming the Lancashire mosses at £10 an acre, <i>all spent in</i> manual
labour.<a href="#Footnote_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259" class="pginternal">[259]</a> One thousand acres of Rawcliffe-moss in Lancashire was
reclaimed for £9,000, although high wages were paid to the labourers. It
pays, says Mr. Scrope, ten per cent. on the outlay, and now gives
constant employment to seventy labourers. In Ireland, he adds, private
enterprise cannot do such work. There is no capital. With regard to
reclamations made on the estate of Sir Charles Styles, in the county
Donegal, Captain Kennedy, the manager, testified before the Devon
Commission that the original cost of reclamation was refunded in three
years. And he further expressed his conviction that an outlay of £5 an
acre would pay ten per cent. on those lands.</p>
<p><a id="Page_446"></a>What grave mysterious reasons of State, then, have prevented the Irish
wastes from being reclaimed? In the Famine, our roads were torn up and
made impassable to apply a labour test to destitution; food was next
served out without any such test; M Soyer was sent over to make cheap
soup for the million; the bone and sinew of the country were shipped off
to spend themselves in trying to subdue the wildernesses of another
hemisphere, or die <i>in transitu</i>, or on Grosse Isle and such
charnel-houses, whilst nearly five millions of reclaimable acres in
their own fertile load were still left as nature had left them.</p>
<p>The second report of the Relief Commissioners bears date the 15th of
May. For practical purposes it may be looked upon as the first report,
the one called the first being merely preliminary. We learn from it that
only 1,248 electoral divisions had come under the operation of the Act
up to that date, a state of things with which the Commissioners
expressed themselves dissatisfied, for they say the Act should have
been, at the time of their report, in full operation over the whole
country. They found a difficulty in establishing soup kitchens, because
dry meal was universally preferred; and they further say that relief by
food instead of by public works was extremely unpopular with every
class. All works, they announce, had been stopped on the first of May.
To this general stoppage, some exceptions, it would seem, were
permitted. Memorandum No. 12 of the Relief Department (marked
"confidential") vests certain relief officers with a discretionary power
to continue the works in those baronies where it would be dangerous to
stop them, either because the new measures of relief had not come into
operation, or on account of the absence of employment, either public or
private, in such baronies. From the general outcry at the stoppage of
the works, it would appear that this memorandum was very little, if at
all, acted upon.</p>
<p><a id="Page_447"></a>The second report of the Relief Commissioners, embracing a most trying
period of over two months, is very curt and unsatisfactory. The
dismissal, within six weeks, of nearly three quarters of a million of
workmen, representing more than three millions of people, could scarcely
be effected without the infliction of considerable suffering. The
Government were right in compelling labour to apply itself to the
production of food by the cultivation of the land, and they began this
movement in the Spring, the proper time for it, but they began too late.
The 20th of March was far too late for the fast dismissal of twenty per
cent., for much of the Spring work ought to have been done then. They
should have begun a month earlier at least, which arrangement would have
had the further advantage of enabling them, to make the dismissals more
gradually, and therefore with less inconvenience to the people.<a href="#Footnote_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260" class="pginternal">[260]</a></p>
<p>It was either great negligence or a very grave error on the part of the
Government, that they began to close the public works against the people
before any other means of getting food was open to them. The Relief Act,
10 Vic. c. 7, was intended to take the place of the public works, <i>and
that immediately on their cessation</i>; but this was far from being the
case,—a point upon which this second report is not at all satisfactory.
In it the Commissioners express their regret that on the 15th of May
there were only 1,248 electoral divisions under the operation of the
Act, whilst all relief works had ceased on the first of May. That was
bad enough; but what the report makes no mention of is <a id="Page_448"></a>that the Act was
not in operation in any part of Ireland on the 20th of March, the day on
which twenty per cent—146,000 individuals—of those who were employed
on the public works were dismissed. On introducing that Act in
Parliament, both the Prime Minister and the Irish Secretary promised
that employment on the public works should be continued until the new
system of relief would be in full operation, whilst this report tells us
that on the 15th of May, a full fortnight after <i>all</i> public works had
been stopped, out of 2,049 electoral divisions only 1,248 were under the
operation of the Act. Besides, "under the operation of the Act" is
itself a doubtful phrase: How long were they under it? How far was their
machinery complete and efficient? Did the Act, to the full extent,
supply the place of the public works, where it had come into operation?
These are questions to which we have no answers from the Commissioners.
On the 23rd of March, three days after the twenty per cent were
dismissed, a Dublin newspaper said, with regard to the new Relief
Act:—"It is not in operation in any district of Ireland. Even in
Dublin—the head quarters of the Relief Commissioners—the residence of
the official printer—the requisite forms for arranging the
preliminaries could not be supplied to the relief committees yesterday,
they not having been as yet printed."<a href="#Footnote_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261" class="pginternal">[261]</a></p>
<p>On the 25th of March, some of the Irish members appealed, in the House
of Commons, to the Irish Secretary not to allow the labourers on the
public works to be dismissed until provision could be made for their
support under the new Act. It was understood by both sides of the House,
Mr. Smith O'Brien said, that the Government had given instructions
against any dismissals taking place until other means had been provided
to enable the people to procure subsistence. Unless this were done, he
said, the <a id="Page_449"></a>greatest confusion must follow the putting in force of the
order for dismissing persons from the public works, which was to come
into operation on the 20th inst. Seven weeks had elapsed since the
temporary relief bill had become law, and he could not conceive why
relief committees had not been constituted. Mr. Labouchere said in reply
that the greatest caution was necessary in removing the labourers from
the works, and that although twenty per cent. of them were ordered to be
struck off on the 20th instant, that did not mean that twenty per cent.
of the people employed in every district on public works should be
dismissed, but that in the aggregate twenty per cent. of those employed
should be put off, leaving to the Irish Government to decide upon the
proportion to be removed from each district. It would be necessary and
proper to make a general reduction, but the Irish Government was left to
the exercise of its discretion in making the several reductions by
districts, as the executive in Ireland could best decide where it might
be dangerous or improper to make any change, and where a change might be
made with propriety and safety.</p>
<p>Four days later, on the question that the Irish Poor Relief Bill should
be re-committed, Mr. O'Brien again adverted to the discharge of the
labourers from the public works. He repeated, that the House and others
had been led to believe, that the dismissal would not take place until
new measures for temporary relief should come into operation; that,
nevertheless, in various parts of Ireland labourers had been dismissed
before any other relief had been provided; and he had, he said, received
from a part of the county he represented a letter from a Protestant
clergyman, stating that not only twenty per cent., but many more
labourers had been dismissed, and were, therefore, on the verge of
starvation. No one, he admitted, could justly object to the general
proposition of the gradual withdrawal of the people from the public
works; but it appeared to him that such withdrawal, until some other
mode of <a id="Page_450"></a>subsistence was ready for them, was nothing short of sentencing
the people to death from starvation.</p>
<p>To Smith O'Brien's remarks, Mr. Labouchere gave the following reply, a
more formal and elaborate one than the above. He said:—"Her Majesty's
Government were satisfied, after the best inquiry they were able to make
upon the subject, that it was expedient and proper that on a certain day
the number of persons employed on the public works throughout Ireland
should be reduced by twenty per cent. They thought that was a step
which, upon their responsibility, they were bound to adopt, and in that
respect they left no discretion whatever with any one connected with the
Irish Government; but the rule laid down was this—they required that
twenty per cent. should be reduced on the aggregate number of the
persons employed throughout the whole of Ireland, leaving to the Board
of Works in Ireland a discretion as to whether, in each particular
instance, that precise number should be the proportion to be reduced or
not. The Board of Works in Ireland thought they should best meet the
views of the Government, by striking off twenty per cent. from the
number of persons employed in each district, but it was not the case
that the rule had been applied strictly and invariably on every public
work in Ireland; and as a proof that such was the case, he read the
following extract from a report which had been received from Captain
O'Brien, the inspecting officer for Clare, and which was dated the 20th
of March, inst.:—'As in some districts the numbers hitherto employed
are much less than in others, it would be unjust to strike off the same
percentage from all. I have, therefore, directed that the number in each
district shall be reduced to a certain proportion of the population, so
that at least twenty per cent, of the population will be reduced on the
whole.' With regard to the alleged promise of the Government that there
should be no dismissals from the public works until the new Relief Act
was in <a id="Page_451"></a>operation, Mr. Labouchere said 'he believed if the Government
had made any such statement, they would have acted very improperly. They
could not disguise from themselves the fact, that in most parts of
Ireland a great preference was shown for the public works over the new
relief system, and if her Majesty's Government had made such an
announcement as that attributed to them by the honourable gentleman, the
greatest delay would assuredly have taken place in bringing the new Act
into operation.' He also read a letter that had been received that day,
addressed from Colonel Jones, the chairman of the Board of Works, to Mr.
Trevelyan:—'Upon reading the Dublin journals,' writes Colonel Jones,
'it would be supposed that the men discharged from the works had been
deprived in an instant of their daily food; the fact is, that they were
not entitled to be paid until the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and
the payments so made were to be the means of procuring subsistence for
another week, so that with the time between the publishing of the order
and the moment when the money would be expended, ample time was afforded
for procuring other employment, or for the electoral division committees
to have made the necessary preparations for supplying the destitute with
food.' He (Mr. Labouchere) trusted the House would be satisfied that as
much consideration had been shown for the people as it was in their
power to bestow, and he had the satisfaction to think that on the whole
this great reduction had been carried into effect with as little
temporary suffering and embarrassment as possible."</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes one with regard to the above reply is, that
the Board of Works used the discretion given to them with reference to
the dismissals, in opposition to what Mr. Labouchere says was the
intention of the Government. Government wished the dismissals to be
twenty per cent, in the aggregate, which means ten or fifteen per cent.
of a reduction in one district, and twenty-five or thirty per <a id="Page_452"></a>cent. in
another, according to circumstances. But the Secretary <i>naively</i> adds,
that the Board of Works thought they should best meet the views of the
Government by striking off twenty per cent, of those employed <i>in each
district.</i> Probably the Government and the Board of Works understood
each other well enough on this point. Even assuming the extract from
Captain O'Brien's report to have the meaning attached to it by Mr.
Labouchere, as it is the only case of the kind he brings forward, we
must receive it as the exception which proves the rule. The Secretary
next tells us that employment on the public works was far more popular
with the people than the new system of relief. This he asserted in the
House of Commons on the 29th of March. We know the official printed
forms for putting the new Relief Act into operation were not ready for
delivery, even in Dublin, on the 22nd of March, just one week before.
How, in that one week they were got ready, and sent by tons and hundreds
weight to all parts of the country; how the new committees were
organized; how the boilers were set up, the fires lighted, and the soup
made and distributed to three quarters of a million of people; how those
people discussed its flavour and qualities, and how they had had time to
give expression to their views, and how those views reached the Irish
Secretary in London before the 29th of March, are things which could be
only explained by the Irish Secretary himself. This fact, however, was
known to the general public, that on the 23rd of March there was not a
quart of the new relief-system soup yet made in Ireland; and that on the
29th, at the moment the Secretary was answering Smith O'Brien, it is
more than probable that the fact was still the same.</p>
<p>The promise which Mr. O'Brien said the Government was understood to have
made, and which Mr. Labouchere treats so cavalierly in his reply, was
contained in the following words, spoken by the First Minister on
bringing <a id="Page_453"></a>forward the new Relief Bill:—"We must take care—and the Lord
Lieutenant is prepared to take care—that the substitution of this
system for public works shall be made as easy in the transition as
possible. There will be no rude dismissal of the people at once, who
otherwise might find great difficulty in obtaining subsistence; but when
the arrangements are made for carrying the scheme I have described into
effect, it will be provided that no further presentments shall be made,
and no new public works undertaken."<a href="#Footnote_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262" class="pginternal">[262]</a> These are strong words, and
were certainly meant to convey that there was to be no interregnum in
which the people would be left to starve between the cessation of the
public works and the establishment of the new system of relief.</p>
<p>But the most curious part of Mr. Labouchere's explanation is the extract
from Colonel Jones's letter. In the Colonel's opinion it was a great
mistake of the Dublin press to assume that the men discharged from the
works had been deprived, in an instant, of their daily food. No such,
thing: it was gross ignorance or wilful calumny to assert it. The
dismissed labourers, Colonel Jones tells us, had no right to claim their
wages till Tuesday or Wednesday, yet he generously pays them on the
Saturday—two or three days before! But did he pay them for the Monday
and the Tuesday?—not a word about that. Then where was the generosity?
The order was that the men were to be dismissed on Saturday, the 20th of
March, and Colonel Jones's vast bounty consisted in paying them the day
he dismissed them, instead of compelling them to loiter about two or
three days waiting to be paid. It well became Colonel Jones, indeed, to
brag of such an act, in face of the many inquests at which such verdicts
as this were returned:—"Died of hunger, in consequence of not being
paid by the Board of Works, a fortnight's wages being due at the time of
death."</p>
<p><a id="Page_454"></a>Some time previous to this, the Irish Secretary said in the House of
Commons that there was an organized combination amongst the people not
to till their farms. Such a combination could hardly exist to any
considerable extent, but there can be little doubt that a strong feeling
had sprung up in the minds of the people against tilling their farms,
not because they were opposed to tillage, but for quite another reason:
they felt that whatever labour they might expend upon their farms would
be thrown away, as far as they were concerned, because they knew full
well that the landlords would seize the produce of their farms for rent,
so that after expending their labour they would be still left to
starve,—in fact, that they would be tilling the land for others instead
of for themselves. Rents at the time were, of course, over due, and the
landlords' power to seize was unlimited. At a meeting of the Claremorris
deanery it was declared, that the assertion in the House of Commons,
that there was a systematic combination not to till the ground, was a
great calumny; and further, that there should be legal security that the
people would get the fruit of their labour in autumn. A petition to
Parliament from Ballinrobe says:—"Your petitioners have read with the
utmost alarm the letter of the Secretary of the Board of Works,
directing that twenty out of every hundred should be put out of
employment on Saturday, the 20th inst., as we are convinced that death
by starvation to thousands will be the result of such a fatal measure.
That we pray your honourable House, to direct the Board of Works to have
the persons now employed on the public works transferred to labour on
their own holdings, at the same rate of wages as if on the public works,
from the 25th of March, inst., to the 1st of May next, enabling them, at
the same time, to have seed on reasonable terms sufficient to sow their
little farms, to prevent the recurrence of famine next year."</p>
<p>The effect of the dismissals soon began to manifest itself <a id="Page_455"></a>in
complaints and remonstrances. Of Balla, in the county of Mayo, we read
that the order was rigidly enforced there, that the people had no seed
to sow their land, and that there was no provision for supplying them
with food. All remonstrance with the inspecting officer, writes a
correspondent from Ballyglass, in the same county, is useless; he said
the Government orders were peremptory. No seed. No food.</p>
<p>Ballnigh, Co. Cavan: Twenty per cent. dismissed, no provision whatever
having been made for their support.</p>
<p>Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford: No provision made to supply food to the
dismissed labourers.</p>
<p>Clones, Co. Monaghan: No provision.</p>
<p>Maryborough, Queen's Co.: No means of support.</p>
<p>Clonmel, Tipperary: No provision. The relief committee under the new Act
is in course of organization, but some time must elapse before it can
afford relief.</p>
<p>From persons who were in possession of some land, the first twenty per
cent., as we have seen, were to be selected for dismissal, but in
Kilnaleck, in the County of Cavan, all those employed on the public
works were about equally destitute, so that the twenty per cent. with
land could not be furnished: lots had to be cast, and those on whom the
lot for dismissal fell received it like a sentence of death. Of course
the Board of Works felt they were best carrying out the intentions of
Government by dismissing the full twenty per cent. at Kilnaleck.</p>
<p>The state of things in Cashel was this: the twenty per cent. were
dismissed before the committee had any preparation made, or was, in
fact, appointed. The old committee had emphatically protested against
the dismissal, and published a resolution condemnatory of it, as an
inexcusable cruelty. Although twenty per cent. of the labouring
population were turned adrift in that locality, not one supernumerary
was disemployed. No pay-clerk lost his salary, though his labour was
diminished by one-fifth; no <a id="Page_456"></a>check-clerk was dismissed, though there
were twenty per cent. fewer to check; no steward or under-steward was
displaced. Such are specimens of the accounts from nearly every part of
the country.</p>
<p>Threatening meetings of the disemployed began to be held. Towards the
end of April we read of vast crowds assembling in the neighbourhood of
Drone, county Tipperary, crying aloud for food and employment. They
consisted chiefly of the dismissed labourers. Their wretched emaciated
children were clinging to them for sustenance, but they had not
wherewith to satisfy their hunger. Large numbers also assembled near
Thurles, crying out for bread and employment; they proceeded to that
town, and had an interview with the head officer under the Board of
Works.<a href="#Footnote_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263" class="pginternal">[263]</a></p>
<p>The news from Galway was, that the funds of the old relief committee
were completely exhausted, and although it was the 5th of May, the new
one had not completed the lists, so as to procure food for distribution
to the unemployed destitute. Some of the public works were stopped for
want of money; the labourers on the others were dismissed, with a very
few exceptions. The labourers paraded the streets with a white flag
bearing the inscription, "We are starving;" "Bread or employment." They
conducted themselves with the utmost order.</p>
<p>About four hundred men who had been employed on the public works near
Ballygarvan assembled and marched in procession into Cork. Having drawn
up before the door of the Board of Works' office, they sent a deputation
to confer with Captain Broughton, to state the distress they were
suffering, in consequence of being suddenly dismissed off the works. He
assured them he could do nothing for them.</p>
<p><a id="Page_457"></a>The <i>Limerick Reporter</i> says: "On Monday morning the people of Meelick
and its neighbourhood, who had been lately discharged from the public
works, assembled at Ahernan Cross, to the number of two hundred, and
afterwards proceeded to the residence of Mr. Delmege, J.P., of Castle
Park, with whom they had an interview, declaring that they should get
work; that they were ready and willing to work, but that they would not
put up with nor endure the use of soup or porridge; that they could not,
nor would they live upon one pound of meal in the twenty-four hours."
They proceeded to the soup-kitchen of the parish, broke the boiler and
all utensils belonging to the kitchen, and tore the books which
contained the names of those to be relieved. Their numbers increased to
about six hundred, when they proceeded to demolish the soup-kitchen at
Ardnacrusha, quite close to the police barrack. The police succeeded in
taking a man named Pat Griffin in the act of breaking the boiler with a
large stone hammer, and succeeded in getting him into the barracks. The
crowd attempted to rescue him. They broke the windows, and were
demolishing the doors, when the police began to fire from within. Two
men were severely wounded. The police discharged forty rounds before the
people dispersed. Griffin stated that neither himself, nor many of the
people assembled, had eaten any food for two or three days.</p>
<p>In several other places the soup-kitchens were attacked, and the boilers
broken or attempted to be broken. At Kilfenora, the people carried off
the boiler and threw it into a lough. So that in the matter of the new
relief system, the Government were not only very slow in getting it into
operation, but when they did so, it was distasteful to the people in
various places. How slow they were appears from an answer given to a
question asked by Lord Fitzwilliam in the House of Lords, so late as the
11th of May. On that day he asked the Government to what extent the new
Act—commonly known as the Soup-kitchen Act—had <a id="Page_458"></a>been brought into
operation. Lord Lansdowne, in reply, said that "there had been
preparations in various places under the auspices of the relief
committees, and with the aid of voluntary contributions they were
putting the Act into operation; but <i>the Act had been so recently
passed</i>, the Government had no exact information upon the subject;
inquiries, however, should be instituted." The Act had become law on the
26th of February, nearly three months before; besides which, the
Government were, or said they were, organizing beforehand the machinery
by which it was to be carried out, and it was specially intended to take
the place of the relief works, all of which had ceased on the 1st of
May, so that Lord Lansdowne's reply was a very cool one under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>Although the spring work must have absorbed a very considerable portion
of the dismissed labourers, it did not absorb them all, nor anything
near it; whilst those who failed to get employment, or were unfit for
it, had not the new relief to turn to. The poorhouses became dangerously
crowded. The poorlaw statistics of 1847 show this in a striking manner:
in the beginning of the year—that is in mid-winter, a time when there
is scarcely any employment—the total number receiving relief in the
Irish workhouses was 52,626. One month after the dismissals of the 20th
of March—namely, on the 17th of April, perhaps the very busiest period
in the farmer's year—the number in the workhouses had doubled; the
figure standing on that day at 104,200; being about 11,000 more than
they were built to accommodate; nor did this suffer any notable
diminution until the harvest came in.</p>
<p>The Relief Commissioners published their third report on the 17th of
June, at which time 1677 electoral divisions were under the operation of
the Relief Act; being 429 more than at the date of the second report,
the 15th of May. They were then distributing 1,923,361 rations per day
gratuitously, at an average cost of 2-1/2d. per ration; <a id="Page_459"></a>and 92,326
rations were sold, making in all 2,015,687 rations. Of the 1677
electoral divisions under the Act, 1479 had received loans or grants,
198 had not applied for any advances, and 312 had not sent in any return
up to the time the report was published. The Commissioners make this
calculation: If, they say, the number of rations necessary for the
returns still to be received shall be in proportion to those of which we
have already cognizance, the entire number of rations will be 2,388,475;
and if the ordinary proportion for children at half rations be added,
the number of persons to receive relief will be 2,729,684, of whom
2,622,684 will receive relief gratuitously.</p>
<p>The springing up of abuses under such an extensive system of relief was
unavoidable, some of which the Commissioners mention in their third
report. Cases occurred in which more rations were demanded than there
were individuals in the whole district. Hundreds of names were struck
off by the inspecting officers, including servants and men in the
constant employ of persons of station and property; these latter were
frequently themselves members of the committees; and in some cases the
very chairmen, being magistrates, have sanctioned the issue of rations
to tenants of their own of considerable holdings, possessed of live
stock, and who, it was found, had paid up their last half year's rent.
The intimidation attempted in various places, say the Commissioners, was
generally successfully resisted, although to this there were exceptions
deserving of notice. It was reported to them that the introduction of
cooked food had produced the best effects on the health and appearance
of the people.</p>
<p>An inspector asks this question: "Is a man who owns a horse, or a cow,
or such things, destitute?" The Commissioners answer: "No, in the
abstract; but better give him relief than to drive him to permanent
destitution." On the 27th of May an inspector, who appears to have been
in a state of worry and excitement, writes to head-<a id="Page_460"></a>quarters:—"Entirely
deserted by the landlords and their representatives; the working of the
Committee [he names a particular committee] has fallen into the hands of
a class who insist on '<i>Universal Relief!</i>' who will not think of
scrutinizing lists to prevent fraud, and who are eager to have brothers,
cousins, and dependants employed in the distribution." Alluding to the
violence on the part of the people, another inspector writes: "I have
spoken to the Roman Catholic Clergymen on this subject, and take this
opportunity of stating that I have received great assistance from those
gentlemen." Another says: "The people who ought to have an interest in
checking abuses are mostly absentees, and the few who are living in the
country try all they can to provide for their own tenants." Another:
"All jobbing and intrigue here." Another: "A day or two since I found
the wife of a coachman of a magistrate of £2,000 a year on the relief
list." The Commissioners, however, were strongly of opinion that the
introduction of cooked food was a great means of checking fraud.</p>
<p>Up to the 17th of June there were 570 electoral divisions which had
received neither grant nor loan; some of these were the richest, and
some were the poorest in the country. Perhaps, says the Report, the rich
ones had other means, and the poor ones could not get the loan, and may
have had the remains of subscriptions. The Commissioners had much
difficulty in getting the accounts from committees; the clerks in rural
districts were, for the most part, totally inefficient, and the weekly
stipend of twenty-one shillings was not sufficient to induce any person
accustomed to keep accounts to quit the towns and undertake such duties.</p>
<p>Ireland, it would seem, was destined at this time to have sorrow upon
sorrow; her great Liberator, O'Connell, died in May, 1847. For some time
his powers had been evidently failing, and no wonder, after the life of
hard work he had gone through. Besides, he was in his <a id="Page_461"></a>seventy-second
year. Many members of his family lived to be much older, and he used to
say, good-humouredly, that they had a trick of living till ninety. But
they did not labour as he did. The writer heard him in Conciliation
Hall, shortly before he went to England for the last time, and his
feebleness was painful, especially to any one who remembered his proud,
defiant energy in earlier years. The quarrels and dissensions, which had
arisen amongst the national party teased, and depressed him, and must
have affected his health. It was observed, too, by his friends, and
indeed by all, that his imprisonment in Richmond told considerably upon
him; his speeches, after his liberation, lacking that buoyant pleasantry
for which they were wont to be remarkable. The famine also weighed
heavily upon his spirits; every question, he frequently said, must be
postponed but the one of saving the lives of the people. We need not,
however, go in search of causes for his death; he had done the work of a
host of men, he was seventy-two, and it was natural he should die; but
the Irish people were not at all prepared for his death: no, in their
affection for him, they had made up their minds that their Liberator was
to live up to that ninety, which he had so often promised them,—and,
with the vigour of forty-five.</p>
<p>In the last days of March, 1847, O'Connell left Dublin for London, to
attend his parliamentary duties. He presented some petitions on the 1st
of February, and spoke at some length about the Famine on the 8th; his
speech, the last he ever made, occupying about one hundred lines of a
newspaper column. He was imperfectly heard. One report says, "Mr.
O'Connell rose, but spoke very indistinctly, and directed his voice very
much to the lower part of the house." The opening remark in Hansard
is,—"Mr. O'Connell was <i>understood to</i> say." He was very kindly
received by the house; hears and cheers are thickly strewn through his
speech as reported. This was in part, no <a id="Page_462"></a>doubt, the kindness of pity
for the great old man, in the hour of his feebleness and humiliation.
For he, who in the day of his might, had hurled "his high and haughty
defiance" at them all, was there to crave bread, to save the lives of
those millions with whom he had so often threatened them. His last words
were an appeal to their charity; they also contained a prophecy, which
was, alas! but too strictly verified. "She is in your hands," he said,
"she is in your power. If you don't save her, she can't save herself;
and I solemnly call upon you to recollect that I predict, with the
sincerest conviction, that one-fourth of her population will perish,
unless you come to her relief. (Cheers from both sides)."</p>
<p>So ended the public career of the great leader of the Irish nation, to
be followed in two short months by his death. Two days after he had
spoken in the House of Commons, the rumour reached the Clubs that he was
dangerously ill. This was contradicted, and a letter from himself to the
Repeal Association, which was read at their next meeting, reassured the
public. Next, the news came that writing fatigued him, and that his
physicians forbade it; so, for the future his son John wrote, in his own
name, to the Association, always, as might be expected, taking the
sanguine view of his father's health. A month passed. His physicians
ordered him to Hastings, and after spending a fortnight there he sailed
for France. His intention was to go to Rome. At Lyons, he felt so poorly
that he was obliged to refuse audiences to the various deputations of
that Catholic city, which crowded to his hotel to do him honour. He
arrived at Genoa, his final stage, on the 6th of May, and breathed his
last in that city on the evening of the 15th, with the tranquillity of a
child. His faithful friend, the Rev. Dr. Miley, and several of the
principal clergy of the place were kneeling in prayer around his bed
when he expired.</p>
<p>O'Connell's character has been traced by many eloquent <a id="Page_463"></a>pens, some
friendly, some the reverse, but all are forced to admit that the powers
with which he was gifted were of the highest order. He first became
distinguished as a lawyer; soon after being called, he distanced those
of his own standing, and in time, his legal opinion was regarded as
oracular. Crown lawyers, and even judges feared him, as well they might,
for he never spared them when they were wrong. In the early part of his
career, his admiring countrymen loved to call him, "the counsellor," and
it was their highest delight to hear him cross-examine a witness.
Anecdotes of his wit, humour, and keen penetration whilst so engaged,
are very numerous, very amusing, and full of character. As a
cross-examiner he had no rival at all; lawyers of his time there were,
who might dispute the palm with him for profound knowledge of the laws
and constitution of the country, yet some how or other it came to be
admitted, openly or tacitly, that no other lawyer could see so far into
an Act of Parliament as Dan, nor drive a coach and six through it so
triumphantly.</p>
<p>But it was in the political arena he made his enduring fame. When he
entered public life, the Catholics of Ireland were a despised, enslaved
race: not only were they enslaved, but through custom, or by tradition,
they thought, and spoke, and acted, like slaves. Their leaders were the
few Catholic peers that Ireland possessed, and the heads of those old
Catholic families, who, by some means, managed to retain a portion of
their property. These were called "the natural leaders of the people."
They were not remarkable for talents; they were timid; they were
prostrate in the dust, and they half accepted the situation. They had
been so long regarding the Protestants as a superior race, that they
came to believe it at last, and, hence, in the presence of Protestants,
they always bore themselves with the humble downcast manner which became
inferiors. The young counsellor, fresh from the Kerry Mountains—an
athlete in mind and body—had no <a id="Page_464"></a>notion to submit so such degradation
from men who were his inferiors in every respect, and, consequently, his
language was full of manly independence. His high spirit appeared in his
whole manner, and as he walked through Dame Street, Parliament Street,
and along the quays to the Four Courts, he looked the noblest and
proudest man in Dublin—a very king of men.</p>
<p>In attack and denunciation he was terrible. What he said of Peel, when
Irish Secretary, is an example of this. At an aggregate meeting in 1815,
he alluded to him, as the worthy champion of Orangeism. At the mention
of Mr. Peel's name, says the report, there was much laughing. "You
mistake me, said Mr. O'Connell. I do not—indeed I do not intend, this
day, to enter into the merits of that celebrated statesman. All I shall
say of him, by way of parenthesis, is, that I am told he has, in my
absence, and in a place where he was privileged from any account,
grossly traduced me. I said, at the last meeting, in the presence of the
notetakers of the police, who are paid by him, that he was too prudent
to attack me in my presence. I see the same police informers here now,
and I authorize them carefully to report these my words, that Mr. Peel
would not DARE, in my presence, or in any place where he was liable to
personal account, use a single expression derogatory to my interest, or
my honour."</p>
<p>This passage led to the affair of honour between himself and Peel. No
hostile meeting, however, took place.</p>
<p>His best friends thought his propensity of arraigning and denouncing
those who differed from him, was often carried to excess, but he refused
to give it up or modify it. The defence he once made for it was, that it
was not <i>irritation</i>, it was <i>calculation</i> that made him adopt that
style of animadversion.<a href="#Footnote_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264" class="pginternal">[264]</a> The Catholic aristocracy and the older
leaders of the Catholics were offended with it, and soon retired from
any active part in Catholic affairs. This may have been <a id="Page_465"></a>one of
O'Connell's calculations. Although his aggressive propensities were
sometimes indulged to an extreme degree, he was right in the main, for,
the "whispering humbleness" of the older Catholic leaders would have
never won emancipation; and this was handsomely and honourably confessed
to Mr. P.V. Fitzpatrick by Lord Fingal, shortly before his death. Lord
Fingal having sent for Mr. Fitzpatrick, that gentleman repaired
immediately to his lordship's residence, and having been shown into the
library, where the dying nobleman was reclining in an easy chair, feeble
in body, but bright and vigorous in mind, his lordship addressed him as
follows: "Mr. Fitzpatrick, I have been for some time thinking whom I
should pitch upon, to discharge my conscience of a heavy debt, and I
have fixed upon you, as the most appropriate person, because you not
only know me and Mr. O'Connell, but you knew us all who were connected
with Catholic politics for years, and well. You know, too, that I went
forward to an extent, that caused me to be sometimes snubbed by those of
my own order in that body; but, notwithstanding, I, like them was
criminally cowardly. We never understood that we had a nation behind
us—O'Connell alone comprehended that properly, and used his knowledge
fitly. It was by him the gates of the Constitution were broken open for
us; we owe everything to his rough work, and, to effect further services
for Ireland, there must be more of it. I never understood this properly
until they made me a peer of parliament, and I feel myself bound to make
the avowal under the circumstances in which you now see me, preparatory
to my passing into another world. You will communicate this to
O'Connell, and my most earnest wish, that he will receive the avowal as
an atonement for my not having always supported him, as I now feel he
should have been supported."<a href="#Footnote_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265" class="pginternal">[265]</a></p>
<p>O'Connell, as an orator, aimed at being what he was called for many
years, "The Man of the People." In some of his <a id="Page_466"></a>earlier speeches there
are marks of care and preparation, but during three-fourths of his
career, his only preparation was to master his subject; words of the
best and most effective kind never failed him. There is little doubt,
that elaborate preparation would have marred the effect of O'Connell's
oratory. He, like all great men, had a quick, intuitive mind—one, in
fact, that could scarcely bear the tedium of careful preparation, and
the true character of which came out in cross-examining and in reply;
for although great and lucid in statement, he was still more powerful in
reply. Woe to the man who provoked the lion to anger,—he pawed him to
death. His gesture was not very demonstrative, but it was sometimes very
energetic, and when he wanted a cheer for a man or a principle, he
called for it, by a bold flourish of his hand above his head. But
O'Connell stood in little need of the aids which gesture commonly gives
the public speaker; his fine presence and unrivalled voice did
everything for him. It is said he had no ear for music, but his voice
when speaking in public, was the most musical that could be heard: great
in power and compass, rich in tone, ever fresh in the variety of its
cadences, it was as unique and striking as the great man to whom it
belonged; nor was the charming brogue which accompanied it, the least of
its attractions. Another advantage possessed by him has not been so much
remarked upon—the rapid, changeful expression of his features. By
observing O'Connell's face, as he spoke, one could be sure of the tone
and temper of what was coming. Was he about to make an adversary
ridiculous by an anecdote or a witticism? His eyes, his lips, his whole
face suddenly became expressive of humour. Did he intend to turn from
pleasantries to solemn warning, or fierce denunciation? (a usual habit
of his); the dark cloud was sure to cast its shadow across his manly
features, before the thunder came forth.</p>
<p>His style was simple and forcible. He very seldom <a id="Page_467"></a>quoted the classics,
although he was fond of giving passages from the English poets, more
especially from Moore; but the lines which expressed the guiding
principle of his life were taken from Byron:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div>"Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not</div>
<div>Who would be free themselves must strike the blow."</div></div>
</div>
<p>The moment I read that passage, he once said, I saw it was the motto for
Ireland; and up to 1829, the year of Emancipation, he seldom spoke
without quoting it. He avoided figurative language. He amused his
audience with stories and old sayings which they understood and
appreciated. He brought the shrewd apothegms, familiar at their own
firesides, to bear upon the principles he was inculcating, but flowers
of rhetoric he knew would be feeble weapons for the warfare in which he
was engaged. He once indeed complimented Sheil, by calling him "the
brightest star that ever rose in the murky horizon of his afflicted
country;" but that suited the man and the occasion.</p>
<p>He had a true conception of what a great teacher ought to be; and for
this reason he kept repeating his principles and his arguments in the
same or almost the same words. Many an admirer of his thought he dosed
his countrymen far too much with, "first flower of the earth," and
"Hereditary bondsmen;" but, as he said about his attacks on men, it was
<i>calculation</i> made him do it, and he proclaimed this so late as 1846, at
the Repeal Association, in the following words: "I have often said, and
repeated it over and over again, that I had found, that it was not
sufficient in politics to enunciate a new proposition, one, or two, or
three times. I continue to repeat it, until it comes back like an echo
from the different parts of the country; then I know it is understood,
and I leave it to its fate." The lesson had been learned.</p>
<p>Physically, O'Connell was a very powerful man. He was taller than he
seemed, his muscular frame taking away, <a id="Page_468"></a>in appearance, from his height.
The earliest portraits of him make him a soft-faced athletic young man,
very likely to be a dangerous antagonist in the prize ring, but his
features, as given at the time, bear scarcely any resemblance to later
portraits of him. His shoulders were broad, and in walking he pushed
them forward alternately in a rather remarkable manner. This
peculiarity, arising more from physical necessity than from choice, gave
him a sort of slinging gait, which caused a Tory print to call him,
derisively, "Swaggering Dan." This nickname of their favourite did not
offend the people, they even thought it appropriate, there was such a
dashing independence in his whole manner; and Shiel never wrote anything
more felicitously true, than when he said of him—"He shoulders his
umbrella like a pike, and throws out his legs, as if he were kicking
Protestant ascendancy before him."</p>
<p>O'Connell was a liberal in the highest sense; he loved toleration; but
he was also a Catholic to the heart's core—thorough, uncompromising:
proud of the down-trodden Church to which he belonged, with—at first,
perhaps, an intuitive feeling; later on, the proud consciousness, that
his name would be linked with her struggles and her triumphs.</p>
<p>"One of my earliest aspirations," he more than once said, "was to do
something for the good of my country, and write my name on the page of
her history." He was fervently devoted to the holy practices of the
Catholic Church. The fatal result of his duel with Captain D'Esterre,
seems to have exercised a marked influence upon his whole life, and he
frequently alluded to it in terms of the profoundest regret. It was a
sight not to be forgotten, to see him attend Mass and receive Holy
Communion in Clarendon Street. When he was at home, his habit was to
walk from Merrion Square to that, his favourite chapel, to eight o'clock
Mass. On those occasions he usually wore a very ample cloak, the collar
of which concealed the lower half of his face. Thus enveloped, he
entered the sanctuary with an <a id="Page_469"></a>expression of recollection so profound,
that it might have been a Trappist who had entered. So it was during the
hour he remained: he seemed perfectly unconscious of any human creature
being in the place, except the priest at the altar before him. He seldom
used a prayer-book, and his eyes were never once raised during the whole
time. Buried in his great cloak, he moved noiselessly out, as he had
entered—a bright example,—a very model,—to the whole congregation.</p>
<p>The remaining reports of the Relief Commissioners do not call for any
very lengthened notice. The fourth of the series was published on the
19th of July, at which time 1,823 electoral divisions were receiving
relief under the Act. They say: "By an arrangement with the Commissary
General, we are clearing out the Government depôts of provisions, by
orders on them in lieu of so much money. These depôts were established
at an anxious period of a prospect of great deficiency of supplies,
which no longer exists." It is needless to repeat here what has been
abundantly proved before, that the people died of starvation within the
shadow of those sealed up depôts, and they would not be opened;—they
were opened when the supplies they contained were not required, there
being plenty in the market.</p>
<p>From the accountant's department we learn that 2,643,128 rations were
being daily issued, which it was hoped would be the maximum relief that
the Commissioners would be called on to administer; 79,636 of these were
sold. This shows an increase of daily rations from last report of
291,028. The fall in provisions had reduced the price of each ration
from 2-1/2d. to 2d. The amount given in loans and grants was now reduced
by about £3,000 a day, the expenditure in that way being then about
£20,000 a day. The aggregate amount of money issued up to the 19th of
July was £1,010,184 7s. 10d. to 1,803 electoral divisions. The cost of
the Government staff for superin<a id="Page_470"></a>tending the issuing of relief, is set
down at two and a half per cent.—6d. in the pound,—a low figure,
indeed, but it must be taken into account that they only
<i>superintended</i>; the committees did the actual work of giving out the
relief. The issue of cooked food was opposed by the people in some
places, and this opposition was punished, by a reduction being made in
the quantity of rations issued in such places. In a fortnight, about
8,000 tons of the food in the Government depôts were given in lieu of
money, the money value of which was £98,728, the daily market price
being that charged by the Commissary General. The arrangement was
carried out in this way: There was issued on the 1st of June a circular
to the inspecting officer of each Union, by virtue of which an order on
the Government depôt was given to the Finance Committee of the Union,
instead of the amount (in cash) of the fortnightly estimate sent in of
the sum required for each electoral division of that Union; but the
whole fortnightly estimate was not usually supplied in meal only, to any
one electoral division; it was given partly in meal and partly in money.</p>
<p>At this time there were thirty-three Commissariat depôts, and sixteen
British Association depôts.</p>
<p>By circular No. 58 it was announced that after the 15th of August the
support of destitute persons was to be provided for under the new Poor
Law, 10 Vic., c. 31. All relief committees were warned to be prepared to
close their arrangements for the issue of rations, when the funds
provided for the estimates, ending on the 13th of August, would be
expended.</p>
<p>The hope expressed in the fourth report, that the Commissioners had
arrived at the maximum daily relief which the country required, was not
verified by fact. The fifth report was published on the 17th of August.
At that date there were 1,826 electoral divisions under the Act. The
maximum relief within the period embraced in the report was: Gratuitous
rations per day, 2,920,792; sold, 99,920; <a id="Page_471"></a>total, 3,020,712 rations
daily!<a href="#Footnote_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266" class="pginternal">[266]</a> Thus, considerably more than one-third of the whole
population was living on what may be termed out-door relief. This, the
highest point, was reached on the 3rd of July; the daily rations had, on
the 1st of August, come down to 2,467,989 gratuitous, and 52,387 sold
rations, being a total of 2,520,376 rations.</p>
<p>The absolute termination of advances on account of temporary relief was
fixed by the Act of Parliament for the end of September. The number of
temporary fever hospitals established under the Act 10 Vic., c. 22,
amounted at the date of the fifth report to 326.</p>
<p>The Relief Commissioners published their sixth report on the 11th of
September. It was a hopeful one. The crops were abundant, and a rapid
decrease in the number of rations issued was the result, more especially
from the middle of August. Out of 127 Unions, which were under the Act,
fifty-five had had no advances made to them, on estimate, for any period
after the 15th of August; twenty-six more ceased to call for advances on
the 29th of August; and the remainder were to cease on the 12th of
September, with the exception of the advances to the fever hospitals,
which were continued to the 30th of September.</p>
<p>The Commissioners expressed the opinion that the discontinuance of
relief had not been attended by the suffering which might have been
apprehended. They say the relief "was made a system of bonus rather than
of necessity, which increased the expenditure in an enormous degree."</p>
<p>We learn from this sixth report that the Commissioners had expended a
sum approaching £2,000.000 within a <a id="Page_472"></a>period of eight months, through the
agency of upwards of two thousand committees, constituted by general
regulation, and subject only to a very general control. Such being the
case, the testimony borne by the inspecting officers to those
committees, is highly creditable to them; the inspecting officers, says
the report, "express their belief that there has been almost a total
absence of misappropriation of <i>money</i> by committees."</p>
<p>On the 28th of August the number of daily rations issued was down to
967,575.</p>
<p>The seventh and last report of the Commissioners under the Relief Act,
bears date the 15th of October. In it they say, they have the
satisfaction of believing, that the Act was thoroughly successful in its
primary object; and they did not consider the expenditure excessive in
proportion to the object. The entire outlay under the Act was £1,676,268
11s. 7d.,<a href="#Footnote_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267" class="pginternal">[267]</a> a part of which was a free gift from the State, the
remainder a charge to be repaid by the Unions, by a percentage on the
rateable property, which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, should in
no case exceed three shillings in the pound. The summary of the accounts
department informs us that the rations issued on the 11th of September,
the day previous to the final stoppage of relief under the Act, were
442,739, being a decrease from the 28th of August of 599,816 daily
rations.</p>
<p>The expenditure under the Act is thus detailed:—</p>

<p>The advances at one time exceeded £60,000 a-day, distributed over nearly
two thousand accounts.</p>
<p><a id="Page_473"></a>The sum given to Sir R. Routh for the food in the depôts shows there
were about twelve thousand tons of provisions in them.</p>
<p>The sum set down to the fever hospitals includes the erection and
furnishing of the fever sheds. In addition to this amount, £4,479 was
expended in providing proper medical inspection and superintendance in
localities in which great sickness prevailed, and £60,000 was advanced
for the enlargement of the Workhouses, principally by the erection of
fever wards.<a href="#Footnote_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268" class="pginternal">[268]</a></p>
<p>In the appendix to this, their last report, the Commissioners bear
honourable testimony to the manner in which the people behaved. They
say: "The order and good conduct of the peasantry, and of the people
generally, notwithstanding the great influx of paupers into the towns,
is highly to be commended. All admit, that the resignation and
forbearance of the labouring classes was <i>astonishing</i>, when it is
remembered with what rapidity the real famine encompassed them."</p>

<p>It is only just to M. Soyer to say that his soup kitchen was regarded by
good judges as a clever and convenient contrivance for its purpose. The
building in which it was placed was constructed of wood, and was about
forty feet by twenty. It consisted of one apartment. In the centre was a
large steam boiler mounted on wheels, and arranged around were a number
of metallic box-shaped vessels, also mounted on wheels, in which the
materials for the soup were placed. These were heated by steam conveyed
by iron pipes from the central boiler, and by a slow digestive process
the entire of the nutriment contained in the materials were supposed to
be extracted without having its properties deteriorated. When the soup
was ready, the recipients were admitted by a narrow entrance at one side
of the house, one by one, each receiving a large bowl of soup, and,
having drank it, [five minutes was the time allowed for drinking it,]
they received an allowance of bread or a biscuit, and were dismissed by
another door in the rere of the building. In this manner M. Soyer
calculated he would be able to give one meal every day to at least five
thousand persons, from an establishment the size of the one at the Royal
Barracks. At the entrance, in the centre, was the weighing machine.
There was what was called a glaze-pan over the steam boiler capable of
holding three hundred gallons, and, at the end, an oven to bake one
hundred weight of bread at a time, and all heated by the same fire.
Round the two supports of the roof were circular tin boxes for the
condiments. Seven feet from the ground at each corner was placed a safe
five feet square and seven feet high, with sides of wire for
ventilation, which contained respectively meat, vegetables, grain, and
condiments. At the same elevation as the safes were sixteen butts,
containing <i>seventeen hundred and ninety-two gallons of water</i>.</p>
