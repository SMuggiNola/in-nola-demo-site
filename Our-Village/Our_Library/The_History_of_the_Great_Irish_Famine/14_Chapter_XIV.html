<p>In anticipation of fever and other epidemics resulting from the Famine,
a Fever Act was passed for Ireland in the early part of the Session of
1846, by which the Lord Lieutenant was empowered to appoint
Commissioners of Health, not exceeding five in number, who were to act
without salaries. They constituted what was called the Central Board of
Health. He was further empowered to appoint medical officers for the
Poor Law Unions, with salaries to be paid by the Treasury; such medical
officers to be under the control of the guardians. The Board of Health
was authorized <a id="Page_475"></a>to direct guardians to provide fever hospitals and
dispensaries, together with medicines and all other necessaries for
those hospitals. This Act was to cease in September, 1847, but in the
April of that year an Act to amend and extend it to November, 1847, was
passed. Eventually, it remained in its amended form in force until the
end of the Parliamentary Session of 1850.</p>
<p>The changes made by this second or amended Fever Act were of a very
extensive kind. By the previous one medical relief was to be given
through the guardians of the poor; by the Act as amended, the Board of
Health was empowered to certify to the Relief Commissioners, the
necessity of medical relief being afforded, in <i>any electoral division</i>
in which there was a Relief Committee. It was also to direct such
Committees to provide fever hospitals, and every other thing necessary
for the treatment of patients. And further: the Relief Commissioners, on
the certificate of the Board of Health, were to issue their order to
Relief Committees, to provide medical attendance, medicines, and
<i>nutriment</i>, if necessary, for such patients as were not received into
hospital, either because there was not accommodation for them, or
because it might endanger their lives to remove them. The Board of
Health acted as little as possible upon this clause; holding that, under
existing circumstances, it was impossible to treat patients with
advantage in their own houses. Those hospitals and dispensaries were
managed by the Relief Committees, under the control of the Relief
Commissioners, appointed to carry out the Act 10 Vic., cap. 7. By the
16th clause of the amended Fever Act, provision is made "for the proper
and decent interment of the deceased destitute persons who shall die of
fever or any other epidemic disease in any electoral division or
district, for which any Relief Committee shall have been constituted."</p>
<p>Whilst this very extensive system of medical relief was established and
carried out under the second Bill, the <a id="Page_476"></a>guardians of the poor continued
to use the powers granted to them in the former Bill, of giving medical
relief. The returns from these two sources give, respectively, the
number of fever cases received into their hospitals, but we have no
authentic means of determining the number of persons who died of fever
in their own houses, or on the highways and byways, as they wandered
about in search, of food. Such cases must have been very numerous.</p>
<p>Although fever or other epidemics did not arise to an alarming extent in
1846, still, that year showed a decided increase of them over previous
years. The following summary, derived from circulars issued, shows the
origin and progress of fever in 1846. "Fever began in Mitchelstown,
County Cork. It attacked equally those in good and bad health; but in
some instances, as in Innishannon and in Cove, many, in the best health;
while in Mitchelstown, the majority had previously suffered from
privation. Young persons appear to have been the subject of the
epidemic, more than those of more advanced life. The pressure from
without upon the city [of Cork] began to be felt in October; and in
November and December, the influx of paupers from all parts of this vast
county was so overwhelming, that, to prevent them from dying in the
streets, the doors of the Workhouse were thrown open, and in one week,
500 persons were admitted without any provision, either of space or
clothing, to meet so fearful an emergency. All these were suffering from
famine, and most of them from malignant dysentery or fever. The fever
was, in the first instance, undoubtedly confined to persons badly fed,
or crowded into unwholesome habitations; and, as it originated with the
vast migratory hordes of labourers and their families congregated upon
the public roads, it commonly was termed 'the road fever.' In
Cloughjordan, County Tipperary, the fever cases doubled in 1846 what
they had been in the previous year. The disease commenced in Clonmel in
November. The accounts from the Counties <a id="Page_477"></a>of Limerick and Kerry do not
record any increased sickness during this year. The epidemic commenced
in the County of Tyrone in the December of 1846. Young persons were
those chiefly attacked there. The fever commenced at Loughgall, County
Armagh, in the end of this year. The lower classes were chiefly
attacked; the majority of those affected having been previously in bad
health. The epidemic materially declined as the poor were better fed.
The fever was frequently preceded by scurvy. Individuals at the age of
puberty were chiefly attacked,—females more generally than males. In
Newry, dysentery existed as an epidemic during the autumn of 1846, being
very fatal among the old and infirm, who, if not carried off, were so
debilitated by its effects, as to render them an easy prey to the fever
which followed. In Dublin, although the great outbreak of the fever was
in 1847, yet, cases were noticed to have occurred in the latter end of
1846, in a greater proportion than usual. Those first attacked were
individuals who had been reduced by bad diet or insufficiency of food,
and throughout the continuance of the epidemic, the lower classes were
chiefly affected. In many cases, the fever set in immediately after
recovering from the effects of starvation, and although scurvy preceded
the disease, neither it nor purpura was noticed to have occurred as a
concomitant symptom. In the Province of Connaught, the epidemic
commenced in many places during the year 1846, especially in the
Counties of Sligo and Leitrim; in the former locality the young were
chiefly attacked; in the latter fever broke out so early as June, when
upwards of two hundred cases were at one time in the Workhouse of
Carrick-on-Shannon; while, in the remote northern hilly districts of the
county, it did not appear until December, 1847; those attacked were, for
the most part, reduced from want of food. In some parts, the fever was
preceded by aphthous ulcers on the tongue and gums; young persons were
those chiefly attacked, and females more than males. <a id="Page_478"></a>In the County of
Roscommon, the previous health of the population was much impaired;
bowel complaints were frequent; the fever commenced in the end of 1846
or beginning of 1847, and was very prevalent. The Workhouse of Castlerea
was one of the most severely afflicted during the epidemic, of any
similar class of institution in Ireland—as many as fifty persons a week
having died at one period subsequent to this—and, for a long time, all
attempt at separate burial was found impossible. In the County Galway
the epidemic of both dysentery and fever appeared at Ahascragh and
Clifden, separate ends of the district, at the end of this year."<a href="#Footnote_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269" class="pginternal">[269]</a></p>
<p>As was anticipated, fever rose to a fearful height in 1847. And, say the
Commissioners of Health, "the state of the medical institutions of
Ireland was, unfortunately, such as peculiarly unfitted them to afford
the required medical aid, on the breaking out of the epidemic. The
county infirmaries had not provision for the accommodation of fever
patients. The county fever hospitals were destitute of sufficient funds;
and dispensaries, established for the purpose of affording only ordinary
out-door medical relief, could, of course, afford no efficient
attendance on the numbers of destitute persons, suffering from acute
contagious diseases in their own miserable abodes, often scattered over
districts several miles in extent."</p>
<p>In January, fever complicated with dysentery and small pox became very
rife in Belfast, and accounts from various other places soon showed,
that it had seized upon the whole country. The week ending the 3rd of
April, the total number of inmates in Irish Workhouses was 104,455, of
whom 9,000 were fever patients. The deaths in that week were 2,706, and
the average of deaths in each week during the month was twenty-five per
thousand of the entire inmates—<a id="Page_479"></a>a death rate which would have hurried
to the grave, every man, woman, and child in the Workhouses of Ireland,
in about nine months! but it gradually decreased, until in October it
stood at five per thousand in the week.</p>
<p>On the 19th we read that, "the number suffering from fever in Swinford
is beyond calculation." Some idea of the dreadful mortality now
prevalent in Cork, may be found from the fact, that in one day
thirty-six bodies were interred in the same grave; the deaths in the
Workhouse there from the 27th of December, 1846, until the middle of
April—less than four months—amounted to 2,130. At this period, dropsy,
the result of starvation, became almost universal. On the 16th of April,
there were upwards of three hundred cases of fever in the
Carrick-on-Shannon Workhouse, and the weekly deaths amounted to fifty.
Again: every avenue leading to the plague-stricken town of Macroom has a
fever hospital; persons of all ages are dropping dead in the streets. In
May, it is announced that fever continued to rage with unabated fury at
Castlebar. "Sligo is a plague spot; disease in every street, and of the
worst kind." "Fever is committing fearful ravages in Ballindine,
Ballinrobe, Claremorris, Westport, Ballina, and Belmullet, all in the
county of Mayo." From Roscommon the news came, that the increase of
fever was truly awful; the hospitals were full, and applicants were
daily refused admission; "no one can tell," says the writer, "what
becomes of these unfortunate beings; they are brought away by their
pauper friends, and no more is heard of them." "Seven bodies were found
inside a hedge," in the parish of Kilglass; the dogs had the flesh
almost eaten off. Under date of the 18th of May, I find this entry;
"Small pox, added to fever and dysentery, is prevalent at Middleton,
County Cork; and, near Bantry Abbey, 900 bodies were interred in a plot
of ground forty feet square." From the autumn of 1846 to May, 1847, ten
thousand persons were interred in Father Mathew's cemetery at Cork—<a id="Page_480"></a>he
was obliged to close it. On the 12th of June, the number of fever
patients in the hospitals of Belfast was 1,840. "Awful fever," "Fearful
increase of fever," were the ordinary phrases, in which the spread of
the disease was announced from every part of Ireland.<a href="#Footnote_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270" class="pginternal">[270]</a></p>
<p>"Of the extent of the epidemic in Dublin, it would not be easy to give
any very correct idea. The hospital accommodation of the city amounted
to about 2,500 beds, a greater amount by 1,000, I believe, than were
opened in any previous epidemic. It may give some idea of the vast
amount of sickness, to state, that, at the Cork Street hospital, nearly
12,000 cases applied during a period of about ten months. At one period
there were upwards of 400 outstanding tickets; and as many as eighty
applications for admission have been made in one day. Still it may be
safely stated, that all this would give a very imperfect idea of the
real amount; for all who had to go amongst the poor at their own houses,
were well aware, that vast numbers remained there, who either could not
be accommodated in hospital, or who never thought of applying. It was
quite common to find three, four, and even five ill in a house, where
application had been made but for one. I think the very lowest estimate
which could be arrived at cannot make the numbers who sickened in Dublin
short of 40,000. The greatest pressure on the hospital took place in the
month of June, from which time the fever gradually declined, till the
month of February, 1848, when the epidemic may be said to have
ceased."<a href="#Footnote_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271" class="pginternal">[271]</a></p>
<p>In February, 1847, fourteen applications were made to the Board of
Health, for providing temporary hospital accommodation; in March, they
received fifty-one such applications; in April, fifty-three, in May,
fifty-two; in June, twenty-two; in July, sixty; in August, forty-eight;
in <a id="Page_481"></a>September the number was ten, and in October only eight. The
applications to the Board of Health for temporary fever hospitals in
1847 were 343; the entire number of such applications up to 1850, when
the Board closed its labours, were 576, of which 203 were refused.</p>
<p>Relapse was a remarkable feature of this famine-fever. "Relapses were so
common," writes Dr. Freke from a western county, "as to appear
characteristic of the epidemic; in several cases they have occurred so
frequently as three, or even four times in the same individual." At
Nohaval, Kinsale Union, out of 250 cases 240 relapsed.</p>
<p>The cases received into the permanent and temporary fever hospitals of
Ireland in the year 1845, were 37,604; in 1846 they increased to 40,620;
and in 1847 they rose to the enormous amount of 156,824 cases!<a href="#Footnote_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272" class="pginternal">[272]</a> of
which, according to the Report of the Board of Health, 95,890 were
admitted into temporary hospitals,<a href="#Footnote_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273" class="pginternal">[273]</a> in which the percentage of
deaths was ten two-fifths; more males dying than females, the percentage
of deaths among males being eleven one-fifth, and among females nine
six-tenths. But the mortality in the fever sheds sometimes rose to
fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and in a few instances to twenty-eight and
twenty-nine per cent.; the cause being previous dysentery (on which
cholera sometimes supervened) and starvation. In Eyrecourt, Ballinrobe
Union, the death-rate rose to twenty-nine one-third per cent.; in West
Skull to twenty; and in Parsonstown to twenty-nine five-eighths. The
principal complications of this famine-fever, according to the
Commissioners of Health, were dysentery, purpura, diarrhoea, and
small-pox; and they further say of it that it was, perhaps, unparalleled
for duration and severity.<a href="#Footnote_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274" class="pginternal">[274]</a></p>
<p>The average weekly cost of each patient in the temporary <a id="Page_482"></a>hospitals,
including the salary of the medical officer, was four shillings and one
halfpenny.</p>
<p>"Some approximation to the amount of the immense mortality that
prevailed may be gleaned from the published tables, which show that
within that calamitous period between the end of 1845 and the conclusion
of the first quarter of 1851, as many as 61,260 persons died in the
hospitals and sanitary institutions, exclusive of those who died in the
Workhouses and auxiliary Workhouses. Taking the recorded deaths from
fever alone, between the beginning of 1846 and the end of 1849, and
assuming the mortality at one in ten, which is the very lowest
calculation, and far below what we believe really did occur, above a
million and a-half, or 1,595,040 persons, being one in 4.11 of the
population in 1851, must have suffered from fever during that period.
But no pen has recorded the numbers of the forlorn and starving who
perished by the wayside or in the ditches, or of the mournful groups,
sometimes of whole families, who lay down and died, one after another,
upon the floor of their miserable cabins, and so remained uncoffined and
unburied, till chance unveiled the appalling scene. No such amount of
suffering and misery has been chronicled in Irish history since the days
of Edward Bruce, and yet, through all, the forbearance of the Irish
peasantry, and the calm submission with which they bore the deadliest
ills that can fall on man, can scarcely be paralleled in the annals of
any people."<a href="#Footnote_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275" class="pginternal">[275]</a></p>
<p>An unusual disease on land, scurvy, appeared during the Famine. The
Commissioners of Health attribute its appearance (1) to the want of
variety of food: the potato being gone, they say, the people did not
understand the necessity for variety, and men, such as railway porters,
who had wages enough to buy food, took scurvy for want of this variety,
coffee and white bread being their common dietary. <a id="Page_483"></a>(2) Another cause
was the eating of what was called "potato flour," got from rotten
potatoes; it was not flour at all, and did not contain the elements of
the potato, but consisted wholly of starch as foecula. (3) The use of
raw or badly cooked food also brought on scurvy; and the Commissioners
of Health, therefore, strongly recommended the giving of food in a
cooked form.<a href="#Footnote_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276" class="pginternal">[276]</a></p>
<p>Emigration played a very leading part in the terrible drama of the Irish
Famine of 1847; indeed, it was the potato failure of 1822, and the
consequent famine of 1823, which first gave emigration official
importance in this country. A Parliamentary Committee was appointed in
the latter year, before which Mr. Wilmot Horton, the Under Secretary of
State, explained in detail a plan of emigration from Ireland, then under
the consideration of Government, and which was afterwards carried into
effect. The emigrants were sent to Canada; and Peterborough, at the time
a very insignificant place, was fixed upon as their head quarters. On
two subsequent occasions, Mr. Horton stated this emigration to have been
eminently successful, which was fully corroborated by the evidence of
Captain Rubidge, before the Lords' Committee of 1847, on "Colonization
from Ireland." But this emigration, as well as that of 1825, both of
which were superintended by the Hon. Peter Robinson, was on a very
limited scale. The number taken out to Canada in the first emigration
was only 568 persons, men, women, and children. The Government supported
them for eighteen months after their landing, which very much increased
the expense; each of those emigrants having cost the country £22 before
they were finally settled. In 1825 Mr. Robinson took out 2,024 emigrants
under the same conditions, but in this instance the expense was slightly
diminished, the cost of each person being £21 10s. These emigrants also
prospered, but the <a id="Page_484"></a>money outlay in each case was so considerable, that
the experiment could not be extended, nor, in fact, repeated.<a href="#Footnote_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277" class="pginternal">[277]</a></p>
<p>From this period, committees continued to sit on the subject of
emigration, almost year after year; emigration from Ireland, even in the
absence of famine, being considered of the highest importance—and why?
Chiefly, because Irish labourers were lowering the rate of wages in the
English labour market—so it is stated in the report of the Select
Committee of 1826, in the following words:—"The question of emigration
from Ireland is decided by the population itself; and that which remains
for the legislature to decide is, whether it shall be turned to the
improvement of the British North American colonies, or whether it shall
be suffered and encouraged to take that which will be, and is, its
inevitable course, <i>to deluge Great Britain with poverty and
wretchedness</i>, and gradually, but certainly, to equalize the state of
the English and Irish peasantry. Two different rates of wages, and two
different conditions <a id="Page_485"></a>of the labouring classes, cannot permanently
co-exist. One of two results appears to be inevitable; the Irish
population must be raised towards the standard of the English, or the
English depressed towards that of the Irish. The question, whether an
extensive plan of emigration shall or shall not be adopted, appears to
your Committee to resolve itself into the simple point, whether the
wheat-fed population of Great Britain shall or shall not be supplanted
by the potato-fed population of Ireland?"<a href="#Footnote_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278" class="pginternal">[278]</a></p>
<p>The same reasons are given by the same Committee in 1827, and they are
again repeated in 1830, by another Committee, whose duty it was to
inquire into the state of the Irish poor.</p>
<p>The famous Devon Land Commission, which was called into existence in
1842, presented its voluminous report to Parliament in 1845, which was
founded on the examination of eleven hundred witnesses, whose evidence
was taken on the spot in every county in Ireland; the Commissioners
having visited more than ninety towns for the purpose;—that Commission
recommended emigration from Ireland, but in a cautious and modified way.
The Commissioners say:—"After considering the recommendations, thus
repeatedly made by Committees of Parliament upon this subject, and the
evidence of Mr. Godley, in which the different views of the subject are
well given, we desire to express our own conviction, that a
well-organized system of emigration may be of very great service, as one
among the measures which the situation of the occupiers of land in
Ireland, at present calls for. We cannot think that either emigration,
or the extension of Public Works, or the reclamation or improvement of
land can, singly, remove the existing evil. All these remedies must be
provided concurrently, according to the circumstances of each case. In
this view, and to this <a id="Page_486"></a>extent only, we wish to direct attention to the
subject of emigration."<a href="#Footnote_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279" class="pginternal">[279]</a></p>
<p>A Select Committee of the House of Lords, on the operation of the Poor
Law in Ireland, spoke approvingly of emigration as a relief to the
labour market at home, and it therefore recommended, "that increased
facilities for the emigration of poor persons should be afforded, with
the cooperation of the Government."<a href="#Footnote_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280" class="pginternal">[280]</a></p>
<p>One Parliamentary Committee, at least, condemned emigration in terms
both decided and remarkable; it was the Committee of Public Works
appointed in 1835. In its second report this passage occurs:—"It may be
doubted, whether the country does contain a sufficient quantity of
labour to develope its resources; and while the empire is loaded with
taxation to defray the charges of its wars, it appears most politic to
use its internal resources for improving the condition of its
population, by which the revenue of the exchequer must be increased,
rather than encourage emigration, by which the revenue would suffer
diminution, or than leave the labouring classes in their present state,
by which poverty, crime, and the charges of Government must be
inevitably extended."<a href="#Footnote_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281" class="pginternal">[281]</a></p>
<p>Previous to the Famine there was a large and steady emigration from
Ireland for many years, independent of Government aid. The total
colonial and foreign emigration between 1831 and 1841 amounted to
403,459, to which the returns add 25,012, for probable births, that item
being calculated at one and a-half per cent. per annum; making a total
of 428,471. These figures give a yearly average of nearly 43,000.<a href="#Footnote_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282" class="pginternal">[282]</a>
Of these, 214,047 embarked from Irish <a id="Page_487"></a>ports, 152,738 from Liverpool;
and ten per cent. was added for imperfect returns. The largest number of
those who went from Ireland <i>direct</i> to the colonies or foreign
countries, from any one port, embarked at Belfast, viz., twenty per
cent. of the whole. From Cork nearly the same. From the ports of Ulster
there went 76,905. From the ports of Munster 70,046. From Leinster
34,977, and from Connaught only 32,119. Those emigrants who embarked
from Irish ports proceeded as follows:—189,225 to British America,
namely, 107,792 males and 81,233 females; to the United States of
America 19,775, namely, 10,725 males, and 2,950 females; to the
Australian colonies, there went 4,553, in the proportion of 2,300 males
and 2,253 females; and 494 persons embarked for the West Indies—300
males and 194 females.<a href="#Footnote_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283" class="pginternal">[283]</a></p>
<p>Within the decade of years comprised between 1831 and 1841, emigration
was at its minimum in 1838, the number that left our shores in that year
being only 14,700; it rose to its maximum in 1841, namely, 71,392. It
rose still higher in 1842, the emigrants of that year being set down at
89,686. The year 1843 was named by O'Connell the Repeal year; the people
were filled with the hope of soon seeing a parliament in College Green,
and to this fact may probably, be attributed the great falling off in
emigration; the number for that year being only 37,509. It increased in
1844 to 54,289; and in 1845—the eve of the Famine, to 74,969 persons.</p>
<p>In the year 1846, as might be expected, emigration from Ireland reached
a height which it had never attained before in a single year; the
number, as estimated by the Emigration Commissioners, being 105,955.
Besides which between the 13th of January and the 1st of November,
278,005 immigrants arrived at Liverpool from Ireland; but the Irish
labourers who, at that time, annually visited England, and who were
variously estimated at from 10,000 <a id="Page_488"></a>to 30,000, are included in the
number. For the protection of the emigrants, additional agents were
appointed by the Government at Liverpool and some Irish ports; and the
annual vote in aid of colonial funds, for the relief of sick and
destitute emigrants from the United Kingdom, was increased from £1,000
to £10,000.<a href="#Footnote_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284" class="pginternal">[284]</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1847, a gigantic emigration scheme was launched. It was
said to have emanated from, and was certainly patronized by members of
the so-called Irish party, which, with so few elements of cohesion, was
inaugurated at the Rotundo meeting; but the father of the scheme seems
to have been Mr. J.E. Godley. By it, two millions of Irish Catholics
were to be transferred to Canada in three years; it being a leading
feature in the scheme to send none but Catholics. It was, the promoters
said, to be an Irish Catholic colony, with a distinct and well marked
Irish nationality,—in fact, a New Ireland! There was a memorial on the
subject which extended over fifty one pages of a pamphlet, and which was
prepared by Mr. Godley with much ability. It went very fully into the
whole scheme. This, accompanied by a short explanatory letter, was
presented to the Prime Minister on the last day of March.</p>
<p>The memorialists assumed that the cultivation of the potato could not be
persevered in, and that Ireland, in her existing condition, could not
grow enough of corn food for six millions of people. Hence the necessity
for an extensive emigration. They are not, they say, to be ranked among
those who believe Ireland incapable of supporting its existing
population in comfort, under other circumstances; far from it. On the
contrary, they do not doubt that if "the social economy" of Ireland were
made to resemble that of England, the population of Ireland might be
larger than it then was. It was only under existing circumstances <a id="Page_489"></a>that
the population of Ireland was redundant, and all they desired was a
temporary decrease.</p>
<p>In the letter which accompanied the memorial to the Premier, the
memorialists put their views, shortly, as follows:—1. The present
condition of Ireland is such, that there must be, for some years, a vast
increase of emigration, they, therefore, urge the necessity of what they
call "systematic colonization," both for the advantage of the emigrants
themselves, and the good of the colony to which they would emigrate.
They think this colonization, "on a very large scale," ought to be made
from Ireland to Canada, and that the State ought to lend its assistance
to promote it. 2. In the second place they lay it down as an essential
part of their scheme, that religious provision must be made for the
emigrants. 3. They think there would be great advantage in enlisting
private enterprise, in the form of agency, to carry out the plan. 4.
Furthermore, there must be a willingness on the part of the nation to
accept an income and property tax, for the purpose of defraying the cost
of emigration: and, 5. To help the emigrants to settle on the land,
"aids to location," as Mr. Godley called them, must be provided.</p>
<p>How was this vast scheme to be carried to a successful issue? A
joint-stock company, to be called "The Irish Canadian Company," was to
undertake the entire management of it. This Company was to be legalised
by Act of Parliament, and recognised by the Canadian Government. It was
to transmit to Canada and settle there a million and a half of the Irish
people in three years, being at the rate of half a million a year. To do
this, £9,000,000 was to be lent by the Government, at the rate of
£3,000,000 each year, on the security of Irish property and an Irish
income tax. This tax was to be one per cent. the first year, two per
cent. the second year, three per cent. the third year, and to stand at
three per cent. until the first instalment of the loan could be paid,
and was, of course, to cease altogether <a id="Page_490"></a>when the last instalment was
paid. Repayment was to be made at the rate of six and a half per cent.,
per annum, which would extinguish principal and interest in twenty two
years.</p>
<p>The £9,000,000 so lent and to be so repaid, was to be expended in this
manner: The passage money of each individual was computed at £3; of this
the Government was to advance one pound, the emigrants themselves
finding the other two in some way—to be given by friends—saved from
wages—obtained from their landlords—however the £2 was to be
found,—that sum was to be provided by the emigrant. One pound to each
of one million and a-half of emigrants would absorb £1,500,000 of the
£9,000,000. The joint-stock company that was to work the concern must,
of course, have profits, and be paid for its labours; it was, therefore,
to have a bonus of £5, or a sum of about that amount, for each emigrant
it would prove to the satisfaction of Government that it had located in
Canada. It was to have other profits. It was to be empowered to lend
money to the district councils in Canada, to effect local improvements,
and the interest of this money was to be a portion of its profits. All
the emigrants were to be settled on the land in Canada; this would be
bought in its rude state by the company, and resold at a profit, when it
had improved it, and established upon it those "aids to location"
enumerated further on. This bonus of £5 on each, emigrant would amount
to £7,500,000, which, together with the £1,500,000 mentioned above,
would absorb the £9,000,000.</p>
<p>As already stated, it was a marked characteristic of this systematic
emigration, or colonization, that it was to be exclusively Catholic, and
that a number of priests, proportioned to the number of emigrants,
should be appointed to accompany them and settle down with them. This
Mr. Godley held to be absolutely necessary. Before the Lords' Committee
on Colonization he is asked: "Has any mode <a id="Page_491"></a>occurred to you by which a
more compacted social organization might be given to emigration,
carrying with it more of the characteristics and elements of improved
civilization than at present exists?" He answers: "Yes. I have explained
my views upon the subject at considerable length elsewhere. I think that
the nucleus of an Irish Roman Catholic emigration must be
ecclesiastical, I think they are debarred from going upon the land and
settling socially, by the want of the ordinances of their church; I
think that the first and most important element, in an Irish social
settlement must be religious and ecclesiastical."<a href="#Footnote_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285" class="pginternal">[285]</a> Again he is
asked: "At the present moment, has it come within your knowledge, that
the want of such spiritual care and assistance checks the progress of
settlement among Irish emigrants, and, consequently, to a certain
extent, discourages emigration?" "Certainly," Mr. Godley answers, "it
prevents them from going upon the land all over America." "How does it,"
he is further asked, "prevent them from going upon the land?" "In this
way," he replies, "they being too poor to take the priest with them to
the wilderness, in order to partake of the ordinances of their church,
and to enjoy spiritual advice and comfort, remain in the towns, where
they are simply labourers, and are checked in going upon the land as
rural settlers."<a href="#Footnote_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286" class="pginternal">[286]</a> <i>Question</i> 1819: "How do you propose that the
priests should be paid?" <i>Answer</i>: "By a grant from this country or from
Ireland." <i>Question</i> 1820: "Do you mean simply the expense of their
emigration, not as a permanent endowment in the colony?" <i>Answer</i>: "I
never entered so exactly into the detail as to say in what manner I
thought the endowment might be best effected, and, consequently, I do
not consider myself as committed to any particular plan of endowment.
The probability is, that the most effective <a id="Page_492"></a>way of endowing them would
be, to a certain extent, in money, and to a certain extent by land in
Canada; but that is a part of the plan which I did not consider
necessary to draw out in detail." The following question and answer
explains what Mr. Godley meant by "aids to location:"—<i>Question</i> 1848:
"What is the practical mode in which you would set about the
establishment of a colony?" <i>Answer</i>: "I would open the country by means
of roads and bridges, build mills, endow a clergyman, and build a
school. Those are the leading features of a social settlement to which I
think a company, or any body that wanted to establish a settlement,
ought to attend first."</p>
<p>The memorial to Lord John Russell, praying that the Government would
give its sanction and support to Mr. Godley's scheme of colonization,
was signed by one archbishop, four marquises, seven earls, three
viscounts, thirteen barons, nine baronets, eighteen members of
parliament, some honourables, and several deputy-lieutenants. The
memorialists were, in all, eighty—that is, eighty of the leading peers,
members of parliament, and landowners approached the First Minister, to
beg that he would aid them in sending two millions of Irish Catholics to
Canada, to reclaim the land in that colony. Everybody knows that the
statement of Sir Robert Kane is accepted as a truth, that there are in
Ireland four and a-half millions of barren acres, the greater portion of
which would richly, and promptly, repay for their reclamation. Yet the
Government Bill for beginning that reclamation was withdrawn by the
Prime Minister, and no single voice was raised in favour of going on
with it; moreover, he said his reason for withdrawing it was, the
opposition which the House of Lords offered to it. Yes; they would have
no reclamation of Irish lands, but they would submit to bear increased
taxation in order to send the Celtic race by the million to delve in
Canada!—yet, even for that it became the Irish people to be duly
grateful, inasmuch as it was a decided improve<a id="Page_493"></a>ment upon the older
colonization scheme of "To h—— or Connaught."<a href="#Footnote_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287" class="pginternal">[287]</a></p>
<p>The colonization scheme met with little or no support in Ireland. It was
suspected. It was regarded as a plan for getting rid of the Celt by
wholesale. A Protestant gentleman, Mr. Thomas Mulock, thus comments on
the memorial: "And is it come to this, O ye lords and gen<a id="Page_494"></a>tlemen!
representatives of the Irish party, with prospective adhesions after the
Easter holidays from the vast majority of Irish Protestant
proprietors,—do you avow yourselves to be in the position of
landowners, who stand in no relation of aristocracy or leadership,
government or guidance, succour or solace to millions of the people, who
famish on the territorial possessions from which you derive your titles,
your importance, your influence, your wealth. Has confiscation been
mellowed into the legal semblance of undisputed succession, only to
bring about a state of things which the most ruthless ravagers of
nations never permanently perpetrated?"<a href="#Footnote_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288" class="pginternal">[288]</a></p>
<p>The memorial was extensively circulated. Amongst many others, one was
sent to the Right Rev. Dr. Maginn, Coadjutor Bishop of Derry. He replied
in terms scathing as they were indignant. The following is an extract
from his letter:—"In sober earnestness, gentlemen, why send your
circular to a Catholic bishop? Why have the bare-faced impudence to ask
me to consent to the expatriation of millions of my co-religionists and
fellow-countrymen? You, the hereditary oppressors of my race and my
religion,—you, who reduced one of the noblest peoples under heaven to
live in the most fertile island on earth on the worst species of a
miserable exotic, which no humane man, having anything better, would
constantly give to his swine or his horses;—you, who have made the most
beautiful island under the sun a land of skulls, or of ghastly
spectres;—you are anxious, I presume, to get a Catholic bishop to abet
your wholesale system of extermination—to head in pontificals the
convoy of your exiles, and thereby give the sanction of religion to your
atrocious scheme. You never, gentlemen, laboured under a more egregious
mistake than by imagining that we could give in our adhesion to your
principles, or could have any, the least confidence, in anything
proceeding from you. Is not the <a id="Page_495"></a><i>ex-officio</i> clause in the Poor-law
Bill your bantling, or that of your leader, Lord Stanley? Is not the
quarter of an acre clause test for relief your creation? Were not the
most conspicuous names on your committee the abettors of an amendment as
iniquitous as it was selfish—viz., to remove the poor-rates from their
own shoulders to that of their pauper tenantry? Are not they the same
members who recently advocated, in the House of Commons, the
continuation of the fag-end of the bloody penal code of the English
statute book, by which our English brethren could be transported or
hanged for professing the creed of their conscience, the most forward in
this Catholic emigration plan? What good could we expect from such a
Nazareth?"<a href="#Footnote_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289" class="pginternal">[289]</a></p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not take up the great colonization scheme. He
said, in the House of Commons, on the 29th of April, that he declined,
on the part of the Government, assuming the responsibility of providing
for the absorption of the great excess of labour then existing in
Ireland. "I deny," said Lord John, "on the part of the Government, the
responsibility of completely, still less suddenly, resolving that
question. What we can do, and what we, the Government, have endeavoured
to do is, to mitigate present suffering."</p>
<p>The Government was of opinion that emigration, left to itself, would
transfer the starving people to the United States and British America,
as quickly as they could be provided for in those countries. This
calculation turned out to be correct enough, as the following figures
will show:—Emigration from Ireland in the year 1845 is set down at
74,969; it increased in 1846 to 105,955, although the Famine had not to
the full extent turned the minds of the people to seek homes in the New
World. The emigration <a id="Page_496"></a>of 1847 more than doubled that of 1846, being
215,444; ti fell in 1848 to 178,159, but in 1849 the emigration of 1847
was repeated, the emigrants of that year being 214,425, of which 2,219
were orphan girls from the Workhouses. The magnitude of the exodus was
maintained in 1850, that year giving 209,054 voluntary exiles; but the
emigration in 1851, which year closed the decade, quite outstripped that
of any previous year, the figure in that year standing at 257,372.<a href="#Footnote_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290" class="pginternal">[290]</a></p>
<p>The census of 1841 shows the population of Ireland to have been in that
year 8,175,124. Taking the usual ratio of births over deaths, it should
have increased in 1851 to 9,018,799, instead of which it fell to
6,552,385; thus, being nearly two millions and a-half less than it
should have been. These two millions and a-half disappeared in the
Famine. They disappeared by death and emigration. The emigration during
the ten years from 1842 to 1851, both inclusive, was 1,436,862.
Subtracting this from the amount of decrease in the population, namely,
2,476,414, the remainder will be 1,039,552; which number of persons must
have died of starvation and its concomitant epidemics; but even this
number, great as it is, must be supplemented by the deaths which
occurred among Famine emigrants, in excess of the percentage of deaths
among ordinary emigrants.</p>
<p>During the Famine-emigration period this excess became most remarkable
and alarming. The deaths on the voyage to Canada rose from five in the
thousand (the ordinary rate) to about sixty in the thousand; and the
deaths whilst the ships were in quarantine rose from one to forty in the
thousand. So that instead of six emigrants in the thousand dying on the
voyage and during quarantine, one hundred died. Subtracting six from one
hundred, we have ninety-<a id="Page_497"></a>four emigrants in the thousand dying of the
Famine as certainly as if they had died at home. Furthermore, great
numbers of those who were able to reach the interior died off almost
immediately. Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Government official, from whose
<i>Irish Crisis</i> I take the above figures, adds these remarkable words:
"besides <i>still larger</i> numbers who died at Quebec, Montreal, and
elsewhere in the interior."<a href="#Footnote_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291" class="pginternal">[291]</a></p>
<p>89,738 emigrants embarked for Canada in 1847. One in every three of
those who arrived were received into hospital, and the deaths on the
passage or soon after arriving were 15,330, or rather more than
<i>seventeen</i> per cent. As the deaths amongst emigrants, in ordinary
times, were about ¾ per cent., at least sixteen per cent. of those
deaths may be set down as being occasioned by the Famine. But seventeen
per cent., high as it seems, does not fully represent the mortality
amongst the Famine emigrants. Speaking of those who went to Canada in
1847, Dr. Stratten says: "Up to the 1st of November, one emigrant in
every seven had died; and during November and December there have been
many deaths in the different emigrant hospitals; so that it is
understating the mortality to say that one person in every five was dead
by the end of the year."<a href="#Footnote_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292" class="pginternal">[292]</a></p>
<p>This would give us twenty per cent. of deaths up to the end of 1847; but
the mortality consequent upon the Famine-emigration did not stop short
at the end of December; it must have gone on through the remainder of
the winter and spring, so that, everything considered, twenty-five per
cent. does not seem too high a rate at which to fix <a id="Page_498"></a>it for that year.
It is, however, to be taken into account, that the mortality amongst
Irish emigrants in 1847 was exceptionally great, so, in an average for
the six years from 1846 to 1851 we must strike below it. Seventeen per
cent does not seem too high an average for those six years.</p>
<p>We have not such full information about those who emigrated to the
United States as we have of those who went to Canada; the Canadian
emigrants had certainly some advantages on their side; for, until the
year 1847 there was no protection for emigrants who landed at New York.
In that year the Legislature of the State of New York passed a law,
establishing a permanent Commission for the relief and protection of
emigrants, which, in due time, when it got into working order, did a
world of good. Previous to this, private hospitals were established by
the shipbrokers (the creatures of the shipowners), in the neighbourhood
of New York. A Committee appointed by the Aldermen of New York in 1846
visited one of those institutions, and thus reported upon it: "The
Committee discovered in one apartment, 50 feet square, 100 sick and
dying emigrants lying on straw; and among them, in their midst, the
bodies of two who had died four or five days before, but who had been
left for that time without burial! They found in the course of their
inquiry that decayed vegetables, bad flour, and putrid meat, were
specially purchased and provided for the use of the strangers! Such as
had strength to escape from these slaughter-houses fled from them as
from a plague, and roamed through the city, exciting the
compassion—perhaps the horror—of the passers by. Those who were too
ill to escape had to take their chance—such chance as poisonous food,
infected air, and bad treatment afforded them of ultimate
recovery."<a href="#Footnote_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293" class="pginternal">[293]</a></p>
<p>It may be fairly assumed that the mortality amongst the emigrants who
went to the United States was at least as <a id="Page_499"></a>great as amongst those who
went to British America. The emigration from Ireland for the above six
years was, as already stated, 1,180,409, seventeen per cent. of whom
will give us 200,668, which, being added to 1,039,552, the calculated
number of deaths at home, we have ONE MILLION, TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY
THOUSAND DEATHS resulting directly from the Irish Famine, and the
pestilence which followed in its track.</p>
<p>The mortality on board some of the emigrant ships was terrible; and,
whatever the cause, the deaths in <i>British ships</i> enormously exceeded
those in the ships of any other country.<a href="#Footnote_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294" class="pginternal">[294]</a> The "Erin Queen" sailed
with 493 passengers, of whom 136 died on the voyage. The scenes of
misery on board of this vessel could hardly have been surpassed in a
crowded and sickly slaver on the African coast. It appears, writes Dr.
Stratten, that the "Avon," in 552 passengers, had 246 deaths; and the
"Virginius," in 476, had 267 deaths.<a href="#Footnote_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295" class="pginternal">[295]</a> An English gentleman,
referring to a portion of Connaught in which he was stationed at the
time, writes thus: "Hundreds, it is said, had been compelled to emigrate
by ill-usage, and in one vessel containing 600 not <i>one hundred</i>
survived!"<a href="#Footnote_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296" class="pginternal">[296]</a></p>
<p>Much sympathy was shown in Canada for the poor emigrants, and their
orphans were, to a great extent, adopted by charitable families. The
legislature of the State of New York, and many of its leading citizens,
showed a laudable desire to aid and protect emigrants, in spite of which
the most cruel and heartless villainies were practised upon the
inexperienced strangers the moment they landed; in fact, before they
landed the ship was surrounded by <a id="Page_500"></a>harpies, who seized their luggage and
partly by violence, partly by wheedling and misrepresentation, led them
where they pleased, and plundered then at will.</p>
<p>The legislature of the State of New York, in 1847, appointed a Committee
to inquire into the frauds practised upon emigrants. It made its report
in January 1848. In the fourth page of that Report these words occur:
"Your Committee must confess, that they had no conception of, nor would
they have believed the extent to which these frauds and outrages have
been practised, until they came to investigate them." The first set of
robbers into whose hands the emigrants fell were called "runners." They
are described in the Report as a class who boarded the emigrant ship and
brought the emigrants to their special lodging-houses in spite of them,
and in spite of the authorities. They took charge of their luggage,
pretending that nothing would be demanded for the storage of it, the
price claimed for which afterwards was exorbitant, and the luggage was
held until it was paid.</p>
<p>The frauds committed with regard to passage tickets were if possible
more grievous than those practised by the runners. "The emigrant," says
the Report, buys a ticket at an exorbitant price, with a picture on it
representing a steam-boat, railway cars, and a canal packet drawn by
three prancing horses, to bring him to some place beyond Albany. <i>He
gets a steam-boat ticket to Albany</i>. Here his great ticket, with the
pictures, is protested; he has to pay once more, and instead of railroad
cars and a packet-boat, he is thrust into the steerage or hold of a line
boat, which amongst other conveniences is furnished with false scales
for weighing his luggage.</p>
<p>A few extracts from the testimony of some of the witnesses examined
before the Committee will show how unexaggerated was the Report.</p>
<p>Henry Vail is examined: he testifies that he is employed by E. Mathews.
His practice is to get all he can for <a id="Page_501"></a>tickets; he retains whatever is
over the proper price and gets his monthly pay besides. The only
exception to his getting all he can, is, he declares upon his oath, that
he "<i>never shaves a lady that is travelling alone</i>. It is bad enough,"
in his opinion, "to shave a man."<a href="#Footnote_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297" class="pginternal">[297]</a> Charles Cooke said, in his
examination, that he had been employed by many offices. He heard
Rieschmüller tell passengers to go to the d——l, they could not get
less than twelve dollars as deck passengers on the lake, and he made
them believe they must get their tickets from him, which they did.
"Rieschmüller told me," said Cooke, "that all he was compelled to pay
for a passenger to any port on the lakes was from two dollars to two and
a-half. Wolfe told me that two dollars was the price, and all luggage
free."<a href="#Footnote_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298" class="pginternal">[298]</a> Mervyn L. Ray swore that he knew Mr. Adams to take twelve
dollars for a passenger to Buffalo, when he (Ray) would have given him
the same fare at two dollars.</p>
<p>One of the witnesses, T.R. Schoger enters into some details. 1. The
first fraud, he says, practised on emigrants is this:—the moment the
vessel arrives it is boarded by runners, whose first object appears to
be to get emigrants to their respective public houses. Once there they
are considered sure prey. There are, of course, rival establishments;
each has agents (runners) and bullies. There is often bloodshed between
them. The emigrant is bewildered. He is told he will get meals for
sixpence a piece—he never gets one less than two shillings, and he is
often charged a dollar a meal. 2. The next ordeal is called booking;
that is, he is taken to the forwarding office, and told it is the <i>only</i>
office, the proprietors being owners of boats, railways, etc. The runner
gets one dollar for everyone booked. 3. The next imposition is at
Albany; it is there the great fraud is perpetrated. If they find the
emigrant has plenty of money they make him pay the whole passage over
<a id="Page_502"></a>again,—repudiating all that was done at New York. 4. The next is the
luggage. It is falsely weighed, and the emigrant is often made to pay
five or six times more than the proper charge. "The emigrant," adds Mr.
Schoger, "now thinks himself out of his difficulty, but finds himself
greatly mistaken. The passengers are crowded like beasts into the canal
boat, and are frequently compelled to pay their passage over again, or
be thrown overboard by the captain."<a href="#Footnote_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299" class="pginternal">[299]</a> The mates of the ships often
took the property of emigrants; their locks were picked and their chests
robbed; for none of which outrages was there the slightest redress.<a href="#Footnote_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300" class="pginternal">[300]</a></p>
<p>Before the legislature took any effective action in protecting the
emigrants who landed at New York, many philanthropic and benevolent
societies were formed for that purpose. Of those societies one Hiram
Huested gave the following testimony on oath: "I am sure, there is as
much iniquity amongst the emigrant societies as there is amongst the
runners."<a href="#Footnote_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301" class="pginternal">[301]</a></p>
<p>What with shipwrecks, what with deaths from famine, from fever, from
overcrowding; what with wholesale robbery, committed upon them at almost
every step of their journey, it is matter for great surprise indeed,
that even a remnant of the Famine-emigrants survived to locate
themselves in that far West, to which they fled in terror and dismay,
from their humble but loved and cherished homes, in the land of their
fathers. The Irish race get but little credit for industry or
perseverance; but in this they are most unjustly maligned, as many
testimonies already cited from friend and foe, clearly demonstrate. If
one more be wanting, I would point to a fact in the history of the
worn-out remnant of our Famine-emigrants, who had tenacity of life
enough to survive their endless hardships and <a id="Page_503"></a>journeyings. That fact
is, the large sums of money which, year after year, they sent to their
friends—every penny of which they earned by the sweat of their brow—by
their industry and perseverance.</p>
<p>Thus write the Commissioners of Emigration, in their thirty-first
General Report: "In 1870, as in former years, the amount sent home was
large, being £727,408 from North America, and £12,804 from Australia and
New Zealand. Of this sum there was remitted in prepaid passages to
Liverpool, Glasgow, and Londonderry, £332,638; more than was sufficient
to pay the passage money for all who emigrated that year! Imperfect as
our accounts are," continue the Commissioners, "they show that, in the
twenty three years from 1848 to 1870 inclusive, there has been sent home
from North America, through banks and commercial houses, upwards of
£16,334,000. Of what has been sent home through private channels we have
no account."<a href="#Footnote_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302" class="pginternal">[302]</a></p>
<p>A public writer, reviewing the Commissioners' Report, says: "Even this
vast sum does not represent more than the one half of the total sent
home. Much was brought over by captains of ships, by relatives, friends,
or by returning emigrants." No doubt, a great deal of money came through
private channels, but it is hardly credible, <a id="Page_504"></a>that another sixteen or
seventeen millions reached Ireland in that way. It is only guess-work,
to be sure, but if we add one-fourth to the sum named in the Report, as
the amount transmitted by private hand, it will probably bring us much
nearer the truth. This addition gives us, in all, £20,417,500.</p>
<p>There, then, is the one more testimony, that the Irish race lack neither
industry nor perseverance. For the lengthened period of three and twenty
years, something like £1,000,000 a-year have been transmitted to their
relatives and friends by the Irish in America. In three and twenty
years, they have sent home over TWENTY MILLIONS OF MONEY. Examine it;
weigh it; study it; in whatever way we look at this astounding
fact—whether we regard the magnitude of the sum, or the intense,
undying, all-pervading affection which it represents—it STANDS ALONE IN
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.</p>

Peterborough has continued to flourish, as the following extract from
the late John F. Maguire's "Irish in America" will show.—"The shanty,
and the wigwam, and the log-hut have long since given place to the
mansion of brick and stone; and the hand-sleigh and the rude cart to the
strong waggon and the well-appointed carriage. Where there was but one
miserable grist mill, there are now mills and factories of various
kinds. And not only are there spacious schools under the control of
those who erected and made use of them for their children, but the
'heavy grievance' which existed in 1825 has long since been a thing of
the past. The little chapel of logs and shingle—18 feet by 20—in which
the settlers of that day knelt in gratitude to God, has for many years
been replaced by a noble stone church, through whose painted windows the
Canadian sunlight streams gloriously, and in which two thousand
worshippers listen with the old Irish reverence to the words of their
pastor. The tones of the pealing organs swell in solemn harmony, where
the simple chaunt of the first settlers was raised in the midst of the
wilderness; and for miles round may the voice of the great bell,
swinging in its lofty tower, be heard in the calm of the Lord's day,
summoning the children of Saint Patrick to worship in the faith of their
fathers."—<i>The Irish in America</i>, by John F. Maguire, M.P. London,

contemplated by Mr. Godley's scheme, but his opinion was that there
would be "a parallel stream of half a million, drawn out by the
attraction of the new Irish colony, which, would make the whole
emigration two millions."

issued 28th October, 1874] gives the following facts. In the course of
last year 310,612 emigrants sailed from the ports of the United Kingdom,
being a larger number than in any year since 1854. Of these, 123,343
were English, 83,692 Irish, 21,310 Scotch, 72,198 Foreigners, who had
merely touched at British ports, and 10,929 whose nationality was not
ascertained. The remittances of Irish Emigrants to their friends at home
were as usual very large, the total sum being, according to the
information within reach of the Commissioners, £724,040. This includes
the remittances of both the United States and Canada. Of this sum
£341,722 came in the shape of prepaid passages, more than sufficient,
says the Report, to defray the cost of steerage passages at £6 6s. each
for the 83,692 Irish who emigrated within the year. <i>Thirty-first
