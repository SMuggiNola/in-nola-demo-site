<p>The Temporary Relief Act, popularly known as the Soup-kitchen Act, was
limited to the 1st of October, 1847. The Government determined that
after its expiration relief should be given through the Poorlaw system
only. In preparation for this arrangement, an Act (the 10th &amp; 11th Vic.
cap. 31,) was passed in June, sanctioning outdoor relief. The harvest of
1847 was a good one, but so utterly prostrate was every interest in the
country, that the outdoor relief system soon expanded into alarming
proportions. In February, 1848, the cost of outdoor relief was £72,039,
and in March it rose to £81,339. The numbers and cost were then both at
their maximum, and according to the best estimate which can be formed,
the number of outdoor poor relieved was 703,762, and of indoor 140,536,
making an aggregate of 844,298 persons, irrespective of more than
200,000 school children, who were, as stated above, fed <a id="Page_506"></a>and in part
clothed by "the British Association." So that the total number receiving
relief in March, 1848, exceeded a million of persons; being about one
out of every seven of the population.</p>
<p>The parliamentary papers issued from time to time, detailing the sums
granted on account of the Irish Famine, are, for the most part, very
perplexing; because, being usually printed on the motion of some member
of parliament, they only give the precise information called for, and
only up to the period at which it was called for; so, not only are they
perplexing, but they are often misleading, although correct enough in
themselves. Then again, it sometimes happens, that the sum voted by
parliament is not entirely expended on the object for which it was
granted. To give an instance of this: there is a parliamentary paper
before me, ordered on the 2nd of December, 1847, which says, the amount
voted under the Temporary Relief Act was £2,200,000, of which sum there
was <i>expended</i> £1,676,000. Sir Charles Trevelyan gives the sum expended
as £1,724,631. The only way of accounting for this seeming discrepancy
is, that Sir Charles's statement was published later than the blue book,
and that an outlay was still going on under the above Act, after the
blue book had been published, which brought the expenditure up to the
sum stated by him.</p>
<p>Here, besides the difference as to the actual sum expended, we have a
considerable difference between the sum voted and the sum expended. But
there is yet another thing connected with the Famine advances, which is
very likely to mislead. The usual course was, that the money issued from
the Treasury to meet the Famine, was in part a free grant, and in part a
charge upon the land. It is only simple justice to state clearly how
much of this money was a free grant, and how much of it was levied off
Ireland, as a tax. The proportion is given in the Acts of Parliament,
but it happens that the proportion eventually paid was less <a id="Page_507"></a>than what
was levied: so that the proportions as given in the Acts of Parliament
have to be altered to the extent of the remissions made.</p>
<p>In the short statement I am about to give, I follow Sir Charles
Trevelyan's figures; being Secretary to the Treasury, he must have known
the sums actually advanced by the Treasury, and the sums returned to it
in payment of the loans granted.</p>

<p>In the above ten millions seven hundred thousand pounds, it may be
fairly assumed, we have all the monies advanced by Government to
mitigate the effects of the potato failure. Our next duty is to inquire
how much of <a id="Page_508"></a>this sum was paid back by Ireland, and how much of it was a
free gift from the Treasury.</p>
<p>The money advanced under the Labouchere letter for land improvement, and
for arterial drainage cannot, of course, be regarded as a free gift
towards staying the Famine; arterial drainage and land improvement go on
still, through money advanced by Government. The works under the
Labouchere letter were, no doubt, intended to give reproductive
employment during the Famine, but the cost of them was a charge upon the
land and not a free gift.</p>
<p>The money spent on arterial drainage and land improvement, under the
Labouchere letter and various drainage Acts, during the years 1846, 1847
and 1848, was, as given above, £1,191,187 19s. 5d., which being deducted
from £10,723,908 19s. 5d. leaves the sum of £9,532,721, of which there
was finally charged to this country £4,845,062. Deducting this from the
£9,532,721 we have £4,687,659 as the amount of money given by Government
as a free gift to Ireland to sustain the people through the Great
Famine. To this, however, there is to be added a sum of about £70,000
paid for freights. The American people, when they had collected those
generous contributions of theirs, and when they had resolved to send
them in the form of food to Ireland, began to make arrangements for
paying the freights of their vessels, but all trouble and anxiety on
this head was removed by the action of the English Government, which
undertook to pay the freights of all vessels carrying to Ireland, food
purchased by charitable contributions. Those freights finally reached
about £70,000. The addition of this sum brings the whole of the
Government free gift towards the Irish Famine to £4,757,659.</p>
<p>The amount collected and disbursed by charitable Associations can be
only approximated to. There is a list of those subscriptions, as far as
they could be ascertained, <a id="Page_509"></a>given in the Report of the Society of
Friends. They amount to £1,107,466 13s., but the compiler of the Report
was of opinion that the sums so collected and distributed could not have
fallen far short of a million and a-half.</p>
<p>No effective means were taken to ascertain the moneys sent to Ireland by
emigrants until the year 1848; however, Mr. Jacob Harvey, a member of
the Society of Friends, from inquiries made by him in New York,
Baltimore, and Philadelphia, computed the remittances from emigrants in
1847 at £200,000, but it is highly probable that the actual amount was
far in excess of that; for we find in the next year, 1848, there came to
Ireland through the banks and commercial houses alone, £460,180; which
sum may also be regarded as a contribution towards the Irish Famine. I
think we are justified in naming £300,000 for 1847, instead of £200,000,
Mr. Harvey's estimate, these two sums make £760,180, which being added
to the acknowledged amount of public subscriptions, we have a total of
£1,867,646, 13s. as the amount voluntarily and charitably contributed to
our Famine-stricken people. But if we take one million and a-half to
represent <i>the actual charitable subscriptions</i>, as assumed by the
Report of the Society of Friends, and add to it the money sent by
emigrants in 1847 and 1848, we will have the enormous sum of £2,260,180.</p>
<p>The most important of all the Associations called into existence by the
Famine was "The British Association for the Relief of extreme distress
in Ireland and Scotland." There are about 5,550 distinct subscriptions
printed in the Appendix to its report, but the number of individual
subscriptions was far beyond this, for, many of the sums set down are
the result of local subscriptions sent to the Association from various
parts. This Association established about forty food depôts in various
districts. They were, of course, most numerous in the South and
West—most <a id="Page_510"></a>numerous of all in Cork, the wild and difficult coast of
which county was marked by a line of them, from Kinsale Head to Dingle
Bay.</p>
<p>Noblemen and gentlemen of high position volunteered their services to
the Association, and laboured earnestly among the starving people.
Amongst them may be named the Count Strezelecki, Lord R. Clinton, Lord
James Butler, and Mr. M.J. Higgins, so well known on the London press by
his <i>nom de plume</i> of "Jacob Omnium."</p>
<p>Besides the sums contributed directly to the Association, the Government
gave it the distribution of the proceeds of two Queen's letters,
amounting in the aggregate to £200,738 15s. 2d.<a href="#Footnote_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303" class="pginternal">[303]</a> In August, 1847,
when the Association was about to enter upon what it calls the second
relief period, it found itself in possession of a clear cash balance of
£160,000. It had to consider how this sum could be most beneficially
applied during the ensuing winter. The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.
Trevelyan, in that month wrote to the chairman, recommending the
Association to select, through the Poorlaw Commissioners, a certain
number of Unions, in which there was reason to believe the ratepayers
would not be able to meet their liabilities, and that the Association
should appropriate, from time to time, such sums as the Poorlaw
Commissioners might recommend, for the purpose of assisting to give
outdoor relief in certain districts of such Unions. After much
deliberation the Association accepted this advice, and asked for the
names of the most distressed Unions. A list of twenty-two was supplied
to it in September. Some others were added later on. The grants of the
Association were issued in food, and the Assistant Poorlaw Commissioners
aided in the distribution of it. Under this arrangement the advances
made by the Association from October to July amounted to £150,000.</p>
<p><a id="Page_511"></a>A peculiar feature of this relief system, adopted and carried into
effect by the advice of Count Strezelecki, was the giving of clothing
and daily rations to children attending school. This was done in
twenty-seven of the poorest Unions, and with the best results. By the
first of January, 1848, the system was in full operation in thirteen
Unions, and 58,000 children were on the relief roll of the Association.
The numbers went on increasing until, in March, there were upwards of
200,000 children attending schools of all denominations, in twenty-seven
Western Unions, participating in this relief. The total sum expended on
food for the children amounted to £80,854, in addition to which £12,000
was expended on clothing for them.</p>
<p>On the 1st of November, 1848, £12,000 was still to the credit of the
Association. By a resolution, it was handed over to the Poorlaw
Commissioners for Ireland; and so closed the labours of the British
Relief Association, so vast in its operations, so well managed, so
creditable to all engaged in it, and such a lasting testimony to the
generous charity of the subscribers.</p>
<p>Such frequent reference has been made in these pages to the
"Transactions" of the Relief Committee of the Society of Friends, during
the Famine, and so much use has been made of the information contained
in that carefully compiled book, that I will only here repeat the amount
of the charitable offerings confided to them for distribution. It
was:—£198,326 15s. 5d.</p>
<p>The General Central Relief Committee for all Ireland, which met in
College Green, received in contributions £83,934 17s. 11d., but of this,
£20,000 was given by the British Association. The Marquis of Abercorn,
the most Rev. Dr. Murray, Archbishop of Dublin, the Lord Mayor, the
Provost of Trinity College, Lord Charlemont, O'Connell, the Dean of St.
Patrick's, and several other noblemen and gentlemen were members of this
Committee. The president was the present Duke of Leinster, then Marquis
of <a id="Page_512"></a>Kildare. It remained in existence just one year, from December,
1846, to December, 1847.</p>
<p>"The chief source," says the "Transactions" of the Society of Friends,"
whence the means at our disposal were derived, was the munificent bounty
of the citizens of the United States. The supplies sent from America to
Ireland were on a scale unparalleled in history."</p>
<p>When authentic intelligence regarding the Irish Famine reached America,
a general feeling of sympathy was at once excited. Beginning with
Philadelphia, in all the great cities and towns throughout the Union,
meetings were almost immediately held to devise the best and speediest
means of relieving the starving people of this country. "All through the
States an intense interest, and a noble generosity were shown. The
railroads carried, free of charge, all packages marked 'Ireland.' Public
carriers undertook the gratuitous delivery of any package intended for
the relief of the destitute Irish. Storage to any extent was offered on
the same terms. Ships of war approached our shores, eagerly seeking not
to destroy life but to preserve it, their guns being taken out in order
to afford more room for stowage."<a href="#Footnote_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304" class="pginternal">[304]</a></p>
<p>The total contributions received from America by the Central Relief
Committee of the Society of Friends, were,—Money, £15,976 18s.
2d.—Provisions, 9,911 tons, valued at £133,847 7s. 7d. Six hundred and
forty-two packages of clothing were also received, the precise value of
which could not be exactly ascertained. The provisions were carried in
ninety-one vessels, the united freights of which amounted to £33,017 5s.
7d.<a href="#Footnote_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305" class="pginternal">[305]</a></p>
<p>The total number of ships which carried provisions, the result of
charitable contributions, to Ireland and Scotland in 1847, is set down
at one hundred and eighteen; but <a id="Page_513"></a>as only four of these went to
Scotland, one hundred and fourteen of them must have come here. The
total freightage paid to those ships by Government, was £41,725 8s.
5-1/2d; but as I find in another part of the Blue book, that between
£60,000 and £70 000 was paid by Government for freights on the cargoes
of provisions consigned to the Society of Friends and to the British
Association, and which I have above assumed to be £70,000, we may take
it for granted that something like twenty thousand tons of provisions
were consigned to both Societies, the money value of which was about
£280,000.</p>
<p>Two American ships of war, the "Jamestown" and "Macedonian," carried
cargoes of provisions to Ireland, for which no freight was charged.</p>
<p>The "Jamestown," a sloop of war lent by the government for the voyage,
was freighted by the people of Massachusetts with 8,000 barrels of
flour. She sailed from Boston on the 28th of March, 1847, and arrived at
the Cove of Cork on the 12th of April, after a most prosperous voyage.
The people of Cove immediately held a public meeting, and adopted an
address to her Commander, Captain Forbes, which they presented to him on
board. The citizens of Cork addressed him a few days later; and the
members of the Temperance Institute gave him a <i>soiree</i>, at which the
Rev. Theobald Mathew assisted.</p>
<p>The "Macedonian," another ship of war, arrived later on, conveying about
550 tons of provisions, a portion of which was landed in Scotland. Both
ships were manned by volunteers.</p>
<p>On the appearance of the potato blight scientific men earnestly applied
themselves to discover its cause, in the hope that a remedy might be
found for it. Various theories was the result. There was the Insect
Theory; the Weather Theory; the Parasitical Theory; the Electrical
Theory; the Fungus Theory; the Fog Theory. But whilst philosophers were
maintaining their different views;—<a id="Page_514"></a>whilst Sir James Murray charged
electricity with being the agent of destruction, and Mr. Cooper cast the
blame upon the fogs; whilst Professors Lindley, Playfair, and Kane were
busy with their tests, and retorts, and alembics; and whilst others
again—microscope in hand—were in active pursuit of the <i>Aphis
vastator</i>, or <i>Thrips minutissima</i>, a not inconsiderable class of
persons, departing widely from all such speculations, discovered, beyond
all doubt, that <i>Popery</i> was the true cause of the potato blight.</p>
<p>"As this predicted system" [popery], says a pamphleteer, "is an
idolatrous one, any treaty with it must be opposed to God's will, and
call down his wrath upon those nations who have commerce with it: more
particularly upon nations wherein its hideous deformities are most
signally manifested. Now, how have we seen in the first part of this
work, that He has repeatedly punished? By famine and pestilence! Oh,
beloved countrymen of every diversity of creed, in the heart-rending
scenes around us do we witness punishment for national idolatry,
systematic assassinations, performed occasionally with a refinement of
cruelty worthy of incarnate devils."<a href="#Footnote_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306" class="pginternal">[306]</a></p>
<p>"This much is certain" writes a public journalist, "that our country is
scourged with famine." Three causes are then given for the scourge; the
second of which is, "Idolatry in the professing people of God,
especially when sanctioned by the rulers of the country." After quoting
examples from the Old Testament of the manner in which God punished
idolatry, he proceeds: "It [idolatry] is just as true of the millions of
Ireland as it was of the millions of Judah: 'They worship the work of
their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.' And to
complete the resemblance to apostate Israel, and fill the <a id="Page_515"></a>measure of
our national guilt, the prevalent idolatry is countenanced and supported
by our government. The Protestant members of the Houses of Lords and
Commons have sworn before God and the country that Popery is idolatrous;
our Queen, at her coronation, solemnly made a similar declaration,—yet,
all have concurred in passing a Bill to endow a college for training
priests to defend, and practise, and perpetuate, this corrupt and
damnable worship in this realm. The ink wherewith the signification of
royal assent was given to that iniquitous measure was hardly dry when
<i>the fatal rot</i> commenced its work of destruction; and as the stroke was
unheeded, and there was no repentant effort to retrace the daring step
of the first iniquity, but rather a disposition to multiply
transgression, we are now visited with a second and a severer stroke of
judgment."<a href="#Footnote_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307" class="pginternal">[307]</a></p>
<p>The Rev. Hugh M'Neill preached a "Famine" sermon in St. Jude's,
Liverpool, and published it under the title of "The Famine, a rod;" a
rod that was meant to scourge England for tolerating Popery, of which he
said: "That it is a sin against God's holy law to encourage the fables,
deceits, false doctrines, and idolatrous worship of Romanism, no
enlightened Christian—no consistent member of the church of England can
deny."<a href="#Footnote_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308" class="pginternal">[308]</a> "She [England] is fondly anticipating, as the result of
generous concession, that she shall witness Roman Cooperation in general
Liberty! Alas, for the Romans! With equal reason might she expect the
Ethiopian to change his skin, or the leopard his spots. With the rich
and responsible inheritance of an open Bible before her, and with free
access to the illustrations of authentic history, this absurdity is
England's sin, England's very great sin. There can be little doubt, that
except repentance <i>and amendment</i> avert <a id="Page_516"></a>the stroke, this will prove
England's plague, England's great plague, England's very great
plague."<a href="#Footnote_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309" class="pginternal">[309]</a></p>
<p>It may be urged that the Rev. Hugh M'Neill is a man of extreme views. Be
it so; but his extreme views seem rather to have advanced his interests
than to have offended his superiors, for he is now Dean of Ripon.</p>
<p>Let us hear another and a very different stamp of man.</p>
<p>"I don't know whether I have mentioned before," writes Charles Dickens,
"that in the valley of the Simplon, hard by here, where, (at the Bridge
of St. Maurice over the Rhone), this Protestant canton ends and a
Catholic canton begins, you might separate two perfectly distinct and
different conditions of humanity, by drawing a line with your stick in
the dust on the ground. On the Protestant side, neatness; cheerfulness;
industry; education; continual aspiration, at least, after better
things. On the Catholic side, dirt; disease; ignorance; squalor; and
misery. I have so constantly observed the like of this, since I first
came abroad, that <i>I have a sad misgiving</i>, that the religion of Ireland
lies as deep at the root of all her sorrows even as English
misgovernment and Tory villainy."<a href="#Footnote_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310" class="pginternal">[310]</a></p>
<p>Charles Dickens is looked upon not only as the strenuous denouncer of
vice, but as the happy exponent of the higher and purer feelings of
human nature also. For three-fourths of his life he wrote like a man who
felt he had a mission to preach toleration, philanthropy—universal
benevolence. He had travelled much. He had been over Belgium and France;
he was through the Rhenish Provinces; in all which places the people are
Catholics; they have received the highest praise from travellers and
writers for their industry; their thrift; their cleanliness; Charles
Dickens saw all this, but it never occurred to him to credit their
religion with it. When the contrary occurs, and <a id="Page_517"></a>when fault is to be
found, Popery, like a hack-block kept for such purposes, is made
responsible, and receives a blow. He had, indeed, a sad misgiving that
the religion of Ireland lay deep at the root of her sorrows. Surely this
is enough to try one's patience. We have passed through and out-lived
the terrible codes of Elizabeth and James and Anne and the two first
Georges, under which, gallows-trees were erected on the hill side for
our conversion or extinction; we have even survived the iron heels and
ruthless sabres of Cromwell's sanctimonious troopers; and we can go back
upon the history of those times calmly enough now. But this "sad
misgiving" of Mr. Dickens; this patronizing condescension; this
contemptuous pity, is more than provoking. It is probable he had not the
time or inclination to read deeply into Irish history, but he must have
had a general knowledge of it more than sufficient to inform him, that
there were causes in superabundance to account for the poverty and
degradation of our people, without going to their religion for them.
Instead of doing so, he should have confessed with shame and
humiliation, that his own countrymen, for a long series of years, did
everything in their power to destroy the image of God in the native
Irish, by driving them like beasts of chase into the mountains, and
bogs, and fastnesses, and over the Shannon. Our people suffered these
things and much more for conscience sake; inflicted, as they were, by
Mr. Dickens's countrymen, in the name of religion; in the name of
conscience; in advancing, as they pretended, the sacred cause of the
right of private judgment. <i>He</i> makes Popery responsible for the
results.</p>
<p>Those who held that Popery was the real cause of the potato-rot were
influential, if not by their numbers, at least by their wealth; so they
set about removing the fatal evil energetically. Large sums of money
were collected, and a very active agency was established throughout the
West of Ireland for this purpose; with, it would seem, <a id="Page_518"></a>very
considerable success. But whilst those engaged in, the work, maintained,
that the conversions were the result of instruction and enlightened
investigation, others believed that most of the converts were like the
poor woman mentioned by the late Dr. Whately, in a conversation with Mr.
Senior.</p>
<p>In 1852, Mr. Nassau Wm. Senior was on a visit with the Archbishop, at
his country house, near Stillorgan, five miles from Dublin. Mr. Senior
asked him, to what cause the conversions made during the Famine were
attributable. The Archbishop replied, that the causes must be numerous.
Some, he said, believed, or professed to believe, that the conversions
were purchased; this of course was the Catholic view. He then related
the following anecdote on the subject:</p>
<p>"An old woman went to one of my clergy, and said, 'I'm come to surrender
to your Reverence—and I want the leg of mutton and the blanket.' 'What
mutton and blanket?' said the clergyman. I have scarcely enough of
either for myself and my family, and certainly none to give. Who could
have put such nonsense into your head?' 'Why, Sir,' she said, 'Father
Sullivan told us, that the converts got each a leg of mutton and a
blanket; and as I am famished, and starving with cold, I thought that
<i>God would forgive</i> me for getting them.'"<a href="#Footnote_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311" class="pginternal">[311]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Whately was president of the "Society for protecting the Rights of
Conscience," and he indignantly denied that any reward or indemnity had
been held out, directly or indirectly, by that Society, to persons, to
induce them to profess themselves converts; and he adds: "not only has
no case been substantiated—no case has been even brought forward." This
may be true of that particular Society, but to deny that neither money
nor food were given, to <a id="Page_519"></a>induce persons to attend the Scripture classes
and proselytizing schools, is to deny the very best proven facts.</p>
<p>In the <i>Tralee Chronicle</i> of the 19th of November, 1852, Archdeacon
O'Sullivan, of Kenmare (lately deceased), published an abstract of a
Report of one of those Missionary Societies which fell into his hands.
The expenditure of a single Committee was £3557 1s. 6d. The salaries of
clerical and lay agents are set down at £382 0s. 11d. What became of the
remainder of the money?</p>
<p>But here is testimony that Dr. Whately himself would scarcely impugn:</p>
<p>Dr. Forbes, in his "Memorandums made in Ireland" in 1852, visited
Connaught, and examined many of the proselytizing schools. He speaks
without any doubt at all of the children who attended those schools
receiving food and clothing. It did not seem to be denied on any side.
Here is an extract: "I visited two of the Protestant Mission Schools at
Clifden, one in the town, and the other about a mile and a-half beyond
the town, on the road leading to the mouth of the bay. In the former, at
the time of my visit, there were about 120 boys and 100 girls on the
books, the average attendance being about 80. Out of the 80 girls there
were no less than fifty-six orphans, <i>all of whom are fed and clothed
out of the school funds, and a large proportion provided with lodgings
also</i>. Only two of these girls were children of Protestant parents; and
in the boy's school there was only one born of parents originally
Protestant.... At the probationary girls' school there were 76 on the
books, at the time of my visit, their ages varying from eight to
eighteen years. They are all Catholics, or children of Catholic parents;
and out of the number no fewer than 40 <i>were orphans</i>. All the children
at this school receive daily rations of Indian meal; 45 of them one
pound, and the remainder half that quantity. <i>Whether this is exclusive
of the stirabout breakfast I saw preparing for them in the school</i>, I
forgot to ask. All the children of these <a id="Page_520"></a>schools read the Scriptures
and go to the Protestant Church, Catholic and Protestant alike."<a href="#Footnote_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312" class="pginternal">[312]</a></p>
<p>But I turn with pleasure from this uninviting and uncongenial subject,
to one more elevating,—to the all but unlimited private charity which
was called forth by the Irish Famine. I have already endeavoured to give
some idea of it, but of course an imperfect one. The feelings evoked,
and the almost unasked alms bestowed with a noble Christian generosity,
during that awful time, can be only fully known to Almighty God; the
Great Rewarder. The Merciful Rewarder has recorded them, and that is
enough, at least for the givers. However, there were some amongst them
who should not be passed over in silence. Baring, Brothers &amp; Co.;
Rothschild &amp; Co.; Smith, Payne &amp; Smith; Overend, Gurney &amp; Co.; Truman,
Hanbury &amp; Co.; The Duke of Devonshire; Jones, Lloyd &amp; Co.; an English
friend (in two donations); and an Irish landlord (for Skibbereen)
subscribed £1000 each.</p>
<p>Irish landlords did not contribute very munificently to the Famine-fund;
but here is £1000 from one, and for a special locality. Who was the
retiring but generous donor? The following extract of a letter will
answer the question; and throw light upon another remarkable offering
sent every month to Skibbereen for more than a year.</p>
<p>"The first case of death clearly established as arising from
starvation," writes Mr. M'Carthy Downing, "occurred at South Reen, five
miles from the town of Skibbereen. The case having been reported to me,
as a member of the Relief Committee, I procured the attendance of Dr.
Dore, and proceeded to the house where the body lay; the scene which
presented itself will never be forgotten by me.</p>
<p>"The body was resting on a basket which had been <a id="Page_521"></a>turned up, the head on
an old chair, the legs on the ground. All was wretchedness around. The
wife, emaciated, was unable to move; and four children, more like
spectres than living beings, were lying near the fire-place, in which
apparently there had not been fire for some time. The doctor opened the
stomach, and repugnant as it was to my feelings, I, at his solicitation,
viewed its contents, which consisted solely of a few pieces of raw
cabbage undigested.</p>
<p>"Having visited several other houses on the same townland, and finding
the condition of the inmates therein little better than that of the
wretched family whom I had just left, I summoned the Committee, and had
a quantity of provisions sent there for distribution by one of the
relieving officers; and then published in the Cork and Dublin papers a
statement of what I had witnessed.</p>
<p>"Many subscriptions were sent to the Committee in consequence, and I
received from an anonymous correspondent a monthly sum varying from £6
to £8, for a period of more than twelve months.</p>
<p>"One subscription of £1000 came from another anonymous donor, and for
years the Committee knew not who those generous and really charitable
parties were; but I had always a suspicion that the giver of the £1000
was Lord Dufferin. The grounds for my supposition were, that during the
height of the sufferings of the people, I heard that two noblemen had
been in the neighbourhood, visiting some of the localities. One was Lord
Dufferin, then a very young man, who alluded subsequently in feeling
terms to the wretchedness and suffering which he had witnessed; the
other, I heard, was Lord John Manners.</p>
<p>"In some years after, I met at the house of Mr. Joshua Clarke, Q.C., in
Dublin, Mr. Dowse, then a rising barrister, now a Baron of the Court of
Exchequer, who addressed me, saying, 'We are old acquaintances;' to
which I replied that I thought he was mistaken, as I had never the
<a id="Page_522"></a>pleasure of meeting him before. He said 'That is quite true, but do you
remember having received monthly remittances during the severe pressure
of the Famine in Skibbereen?' I answered in the affirmative; and
thereupon he said, 'I was your correspondent, I remitted the moneys to
you, they were the offerings of a number of the students of Trinity
College.'</p>
<p>"I need scarcely say that the incident created in me a feeling of esteem
and regard for Mr. Dowse, which has continued to the present moment.</p>
<p>"During the passing of the Land Bill through the House of Commons, in
the year 1870, I proposed several amendments, in consequence of which I
received a letter from Lord Dufferin, asking for an interview, which
subsequently took place at his house, and lasted more than three hours.
When about to leave, I said that I had a question to put to his
Lordship, which I hoped he would not refuse to answer; and having
received his assent, I said,—Lord Dufferin, are you the anonymous donor
of a subscription of £1000 to the Relief Committee at Skibbereen
twenty-three years ago? And with a smile, he simply replied 'I am.'</p>
<p>"I left with feelings of high admiration for the man."<a href="#Footnote_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313" class="pginternal">[313]</a></p>
<p>To conclude. Every reader, will, doubtless, form his own views upon the
facts given in this volume; upon the conduct of the people; the action
of the landlords; the measures of the Government; those views may be
widely different; but of the bright and copious fountains of living
charity, which gushed forth over the Christian world, during the Great
Irish Famine, history has but one record to make,—posterity can hold
but one opinion.</p>
