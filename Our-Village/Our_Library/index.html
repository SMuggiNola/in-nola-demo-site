          <strong>The Stacks</strong> is a (hopefully) growing collection of curated and donated works from the members of the Irish Community in the Greater New Orleans Area. 
          We are proud to have our first contribution to The Stacks: Tony and JJ Muggivan's book 
          <em>"A Tragedy Waiting To Happen: The Chaotic Life Of Brendan O'Donnell."</em>

          <p>
            We’re building a living record — not just of dates and headlines,
            but of families, neighborhoods, songs, struggles, triumphs,
            migrations, friendships, and everyday life. If you or your family
            has roots in Ireland or the Irish diaspora of New Orleans, your
            story belongs here.
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome historians, archivists, librarians, genealogists,
            musicians, dancers, business owners, storytellers, students,
            and curious neighbors. If you have insight, you have value.

          <p>
            The long-term goal is an open, interactive, searchable, and
            beautifully accessible public database — a digital home for
            documents, oral histories, photographs, literature, academic work,
            and community knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            No paywalls. No gatekeeping. Just shared heritage, freely given and
            responsibly preserved.
